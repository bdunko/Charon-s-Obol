Hotkeys for buttons so I can play with keyboard more easily, toss/advance/etc

Feature - Guarantee at least 15 souls from round 1
Feature - Can defeat monsters by 'expending' souls. Spent souls are placed in a separate pile.
Feature - Must defeat all monsters in a wave before you can next round. (or maybe only boss, or maybe each boss has a specific thing that drags out the round?)
Feature - Spawn monsters for every round after the first, with varying strength levels.
Feature - Remnants, which offer single use powers (similar to Patron tokens now) or passive benefits.

Core - Tooltips have a 'preferred' direction (this just changes the default offset)
 - for now, we can just have a Y for upper or lower)
 - but for expansions sake, may as well have left and right too on X
 - Y_ABOVE
 - Y_CENTERED
 - Y_BELOW
 - X_LEFT
 - X_CENTERED
 - X_RIGHT
 - coins in row should be X_CENTERED Y_ABOVE for example
 - coins in shop/trial should be X_CENTERED Y_BELOW

Bug - Fix the rest of the mouse observers
