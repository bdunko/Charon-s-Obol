- [ ] Should be able to view number of arrows in tooltip even if not selectable.
- [ ] Tantalus shouldn't immediately turn itself over IF IN SHOP
- [ ] Bug with Eris - with certain timing, can make game think not all flips are done. This causes map to be disabled and end round button to be unavailable.
	- [ ] maybe just need to prevent eris from being used while there is a coin flipping. It's a bit of a hack but it would be safer.
