**General**
* Measure/Bar - group of 4 individual beats
* Four bar loop - common phrasing is ABAC.

**Drums**
- **Kick** - bottom end and grounding
	- "Grounding" vs "Pushing". Kicks on the beat are grounding. Kicks off the beat are pushing.
	- Different rhythms each measure create phrasing.
- **Snare** - satisfaction, backbeat
	- Additional snares on e and a are pushing, on & are grounding. 
	- Kicks play off of additional snares; nearby kicks can help smooth them out and give them a place to fall onto.
	- Snares shifted off of the 2 and 4 offers even more possibilities; use kick and hi-hat to foreshadow shifted snares. 
	- **Clap/Sidestick** - snare alternatives with a different flavor. Can also be combined with each other, either as separate drums or layered. Can be used to create a fill.
- **Closed Hi-hat** - top movement and life
- **Open Hi-hat** - accentuating hi-hat
	- On e or a energizes; on a beat accentuates the beat.
	- Open/closed hi-hats choke each other (stop each other's sound).
- **High Tom/Low Tom** - pitched; most commonly used as a fill (even just a single tom). 
	- Can also be part of a predominant pattern running throughout the drum pattern; ie a tom-centric groove. When doing so, start with the tom pattern and build the rest around it.
- **Velocity** = volume
	- Adds bounce to the drum groove.
	- Velocity is extra important & common for hi-hats. Hi-hats on the beat are often at full velocity, off can be more varied.
	- Adds finesse to the kick or snare. Usually keep max velocity on the beat. Reducing snare velocity can make extra snares less aggressive.
- **Half-time** - Moves the backbeat to 3 instead of 2 and 4. Then, we can increase the tempo to create very rapid 16th, which defines the half-time sound. Can change partway through a song from common time to half time or vice versa.
	- Closed hi-hat sounds great at high tempo. Other drums should still be kept somewhat simple.
- **16th Shuffle** - Setting the grid to 6 divisions per beat. Use the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th divisions to create a shuffle feel (esp in hi hats).
	- Slowing down 16th shuffle allows us to use 2nd and 5th as well.
	- **Triplets** - 123 or 456.
	- Kicks on 1st and 4th will ground, 3rd and 6th will push.
	- Bass, chords, and melody also should participate in the shuffle feel.
- **Removing Backbeats** - The snare isn't mandatory. Leaving it out can create a low-sitting and grounded feel. It's helpful to have an ongoing kick pattern. Not all backbeats need to be removed. Adding backbeats back at a certain point is a great way to elevate energy.

**Bass**
- Low range pitches.
- Bass and kick must work well together to create stability. Primary focus when writing bass should be on interaction with kick.
- **Bass fill** - mini-melody at the end of the bass to loop back to the beginning.
- **Lazy rule** - start with a bass rhythm identical to kick.
- **Using multiple pitches** - start with all notes in root position, then move some of them up/down. The root must still sound like the main pitch; don't stray for too long or far.
	- Using just pitch 1 and 2 can create movement without implying tonality.
	- To maintain root, play it first at the start of each chord change before any other pitch. 
	- Keep chord tones and non-chord tones in mind when writing bass under chords. Non-root pitches are good for connecting roots over a chord change.
- **Legato** - loosens up the bassline; also can be used to remove attack transients
- **Grace Notes** - interesting, but not often used.

**Chords**
- Groups of pitches played at the same time to create harmony.
- **Major** - bright tonality
- **Minor** - dark tonality
- **The 5** - Adding or removing a 5 does not change the tonality; but introduces voicing - the art of 'how' a chord is played. Don't need to use a 5 all of the time.
- **Suspended Chords** - Unresolved sounding; use 1/4/5 for a Sus4 or 1/2/5 for a Sus2. Pitch 5 is optional. Suspending resolves nicely to major/minor.
- **Arpeggiation** - playing a chord 1 note at a time. Linear rhythmic movement that conveys a tonality. 
	- When arpeggiating with pitch 2/4; can play a Sus chord arpeggiation or just mix it into a major/minor chord.
- **Chord Changes** - switching to a different root. Bass determines the chord's root. Song's chords collectively are known as a **Chord Progression**. Can change chords on any beat. Make sure you can hear the bass pitch when changing chords, otherwise it may sound weak. Beats 1 and 3 are most common for chord changes. Chord change on beat 4 can bring the listener back to the start. Chord changes on Beat 2 can be awkward, but also surprising. 
- **4-Bar Chord Progression** - very common structure with a different chord in each bar. Give melody a lot of space to breath. ABAC is a common pattern for the melody.
- **The 1** - Chord progressions don't need to include the 1, but including it allows the progression to resolve. Leaving out the 1 in a progression creates a more unresolved feel, which can be useful for certain parts of a song.
- **Diatonic** - all in the same key. Common. Always sounds good. Non-diatonic can be interesting, but unpredictable. Sometimes great, sometime weird.
- **Anticipation** - When one or more tracks play a chord change early, 'anticipating' a future chord change. Can increase fluidity. Most common in melody, but can happen in any track or all at once. Drums also can play a role, often playing kick right on the chord change.
- **5 Major in Minor Key** - most common **Non-Diatonic Chord**.
- **Inversions** - Changing the voicing of chords by moving notes up/down an octave. Can be used to write more smooth chord progressions by keeping pitches close together.
	- **Root position** - standard voicing. Jumping between chords in root position can sound clunky.
	- The melody created by the top line of pitches is critical.

**Melody**
- [ ] Top-line. Contrasts against other tracks and stands out.
- [ ] **Chord Tones** fit easily, **Non-Chord Tones** stick out. More freedom than bass, doesn't have to maintain the root. When playing over a chord change, often a good idea to play a chord tone.
- [ ] Singing is the best way to write a melody. Alternatively, start with an arpeggiation then add space, variation, and phrasing.
- [ ] Melodies should have some **space**.
- [ ] **Variation** - shorter and longer notes
- [ ] **Phrasing** - Imitate human speech patterns (pitch, rhythm, spacing).
- [ ] **Legato** - allowing the end of one note to overlap the start of the next, bending the pitch by connecting the two notes. Skips attack transient of the second note. Makes melody less rigid and stiff.
- [ ] **Grace Notes** - Brief note added before the 'main' note to embellish it. Take the main note, delay the start slightly, and add another note in that new space (connecting via legato back to the main note). Can grace up or down, but usually small movement. Common placement is on the first note of a phrase. Loosens up the melody.
