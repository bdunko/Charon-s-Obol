You control a squadron of young adults. They are enrolled in a special academy for dreamers (this is an Enders Game rip off). They are training to fight nightmares in the dreamlands of HP Lovecraft.

The game has 2 distinct phases:
- Academy
- Battlefield

During the Academy phase, the game plays in a worker placement style. There are options available to you, drawn from decks of cards, which you may assign your students to. This can give them new abilities, equipment, and skills. You are constructing a tableau representing your 'mech', of various armaments.
* Worker placement.
* Different decks of cards representing different activities you can undertake.
	* Acquiring armaments.
		* Shell, Core, Arms, Shoulders, Cockpit, Mods
	* Bonding with squad mates - 2 students placed on specific bonding spot each take a bonding card from the other (which have special passives/abilities).
	* Personal quests for each student, telling their story. Variability via randomized cards (threads of fate)
	* After all workers are placed and resolved, move to next month. Draw a single card from the shared dream deck, then each player may choose and resolve one option on it (like Events in StS). The shared dream deck is different from each location.

During the Battlefield phase, the students must fight off waves of monsters in the dreamlands. You use your tableau of weapons to fight monsters.
- Different locations.
- Different 
- Exhausting weapons.
- Energy or heat, some form of cooldown.
- Switching between mech and student form. (Front/backline). Recover in student form and solve crisises.
- Deck of cards for crisises, depending on location.
- Ability to swap weaponry out while in backline (or when given permission to 'shift' weaponry).
- Enemies can be either near or far (2 rows). Enemies in the same row may be pushed into the same group (or may choose to group themselves). Some weapons target all enemies in a group. Some are just single target, etc.

The game plays out over the course of 12 months - 3 months of prep, then a battle, then 3 months of prep, then a battle, etc.
