			- [ ] Ignite monsters.
			- [ ] Lucky monsters.
			- [ ] Bless monsters.
- [ ] **Treasury of Atreus** - 1 week - multiple options for what coins form the coinpool.
	- [ ] Complete - everything
	- [ ] Classic - Olympians (the 13 original)
	- [ ] Classic+ - Classic with a few more additions, around ~25 coins.
	- [ ] Remix/Redux/Remake - Small sets of 25 coins, basically alternative Classic.
	- [ ] Finesse - Tricky coins, hard to use

	- [ ] Fundamentals - Absolutely no coins with Statuses.
	- [ ] Oracle's Choice - randomized pool of 25 coins, changing daily.
	- [ ] Charon's Choice - randomized pool of 25 coins, changes each time you choose it.
- [ ] **Tartarus Bonus Boss - 2 weeks**
- [ ] **Polish - 4 weeks**
- [ ] **Balance**
	- [ ] Fundamental rule - payoffs which are not showing do not happen. Payoffs which are showing always happen. Ex: Blank payoffs don't happen; Frozen payoffs do happen.
		- [ ] Stone breaks this rule. 
			- [x] Choice 1 - Stone coins are also blank.
				- [ ] Stone is more threatening.
				- [ ] Perseus is kinda bad.
				- [ ] Larger distinction between Freeze and Stone.
			- [x] Choice 2 - Stone coins still payoff.
				- [ ] This makes Medusa less threatening as she can hit your payoff coins on heads.
				- [ ] Perseus becomes a more potent coin.
				- [ ] Freeze and Stone become pretty similar? Freeze is essentially a one-time Stone.
			- [ ] Choice 3 - Just make Payoff sides of Stoned coins blank but not power sides. 
				- [ ] This is functionally just a visual change.
				- [ ] I like this.
