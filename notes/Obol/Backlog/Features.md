**Charon's Obol Soundtest**`
Week 6/7
- [ ] **Game Sounds**
	- [ ] I think we forgot to add the power selected/unselected sounds at all.
	- [ ] Death scene
	- [ ] **Revisions**
		- [ ] Heavy water loop is too short and the restart is too obvious.
		- [ ] Don't use the same sound for all button presses; example:
			- [ ] Board - no sound needed because map open covers it.
			- [ ] Begin First Round - no sound needed because map close covers it.
			- [ ] Accept - probably don't need because all payoffs have their own sounds.
			- [ ] Toss - Don't need because 'row retract' should cover it.
		- [ ] Coin landing sound definitely doesn't work.
		- [ ] Coin toss sound, not sure.
		- [ ] In the shop - we don't want charon's hand making a sound every time it moves.
		- [ ] Buy coin sound needs a change.
		- [ ] Monster payoff sound isn't quite it.
		- [ ] Not sure about flip sound/landing sound stacking... 
		- [ ] The turn sound should just be a metallic something...
	- [ ] Additions

			- [ ] Bless monsters.
- [ ] **Treasury of Atreus** - 1 week - multiple options for what coins form the coinpool.
	- [ ] Complete - everything
	- [ ] Classic - Olympians (the 13 original)
	- [ ] Classic+ - Classic with a few more additions, around ~25 coins.
	- [ ] Remix/Redux/Remake - Small sets of 25 coins, basically alternative Classic.
	- [ ] Finesse - Tricky coins, hard to use
	- [ ] Elements - Manipulation with lightning, freeze, ignite, wind coins.
	- [ ] Heroic - No gods, instead only heroic greek figures.
	- [ ] Worldly - nature themed coins, healing focus
	- [ ] Corrupted - Coins with downsides
	- [ ] Metamorphosis - Coins that trade, exchange, gain, destroy coins.
	- [ ] Preordained - Absolutely no coins that reflip, focus on lucky/bless etc
	- [ ] Fundamentals - Absolutely no coins with Statuses.
	- [ ] Oracle's Choice - randomized pool of 25 coins, changing daily.
	- [ ] Charon's Choice - randomized pool of 25 coins, changes each time you choose it.
- [ ] **Tartarus Bonus Boss - 2 weeks**
- [ ] **Settings Menu & Controller Support - 2 weeks**
	- [ ] Add settings menu.
		- [ ] Turn off effects
		- [ ] Settings should be saved to a separate save file.
	- [ ] Add support for controllers.
- [ ] **Polish - 4 weeks**
- [ ] **Balance**
	- [ ] Fundamental rule - payoffs which are not showing do not happen. Payoffs which are showing always happen. Ex: Blank payoffs don't happen; Frozen payoffs do happen.
		- [ ] Stone breaks this rule. 
			- [x] Choice 1 - Stone coins are also blank.
				- [ ] Stone is more threatening.
				- [ ] Perseus is kinda bad.
				- [ ] Larger distinction between Freeze and Stone.
			- [x] Choice 2 - Stone coins still payoff.
				- [ ] This makes Medusa less threatening as she can hit your payoff coins on heads.
				- [ ] Perseus becomes a more potent coin.
				- [ ] Freeze and Stone become pretty similar? Freeze is essentially a one-time Stone.
			- [ ] Choice 3 - Just make Payoff sides of Stoned coins blank but not power sides. 
				- [ ] This is functionally just a visual change.
				- [ ] I like this.
