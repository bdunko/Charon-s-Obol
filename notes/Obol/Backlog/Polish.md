- [ ] Improve prometheus indicator - make the text 'pop' in like the phase text
- [ ] Need some visual effect to denote passive
	- [ ] ideal - rotating pixel around edge, but we would need to do a lot of annoying handling for this; it is not generalizable. We would need to hand-make an animation for each possible coin shape that has a passive. This is doable but inconvenient, especially for trials. In this case, we may as well just make the trial coin size uniform. There isn't really a good reason for them to be differnet like they are now tbh.
- [ ] Patron token passives (Charon included) should do an additional animation or raise or jiggle or something when they trigger. I could see a slight rotation shake being effective for both this and for coin payoffs.
- [ ] can't activate demeter if no coins are showing a life penalty
- [ ] Permanent statuses should say so in their tooltip (OR, the icon should be different - possibly a different outline could work.) Maybe just a little P in the artwork would work.
	- [ ] Bury could also say the turns remaining in the tooltip. Show the number in the artwork.
- [ ] After hand slam during malice, hand should shake aggressively until text advances.
- [ ] Need to clear tooltips when performing transitions, otherwise tooltips can get stuck on screen (try Embark -> hold mouse over difficulty skull)
- [ ] Different coin art for the elite monsters and nemesis monsters.
- [ ] FX - Lighting effects (experiment with)
- [ ] Code - Change text color if not original number on numbers in coin tooltip (light blue = modified)
- [ ] Graphics - Coin shadows
- [ ] Graphics - Skeletal hand shadows.
- [ ] Graphics - Shard shadows while they're moving.
- [ ] Graphics - Show purple bars (styx) on sides instead of black bars
- [ ] After you use a power, if you run out of charges, the targeted coin stays highlighted (it should stop being highlighted). So minor. Ex: Athena can do this.
- [ ] Icarus - include a warning indicator above (flashing exclaimiation point) if all coins are on heads. We can also add this for Achilles on tails.
- [ ] Add a "souls_down" icon similar to the life loss icon, with a cracked soul icon, used when losing souls?
- [ ] "You are out of life..." - we should still pulsate the vignette here, after dying.

- [ ] **Screen Shake**
	- [ ] Screen shake on Charon slam.
	- [ ] Screen shake during death.
	- [ ] Camera zoom in/out slightly during death; frantic.
