- [ ] Coinpool should just be ~20 randomized coins per run.
- [ ] Refine monster spawning further. Only a single (or two maybe) neutral monsters capable of spawning each game. The first wave should be hardcoded to be a neutral monster.
- [ ] Make it possible to use patrons multiple times per round; modify the ones where this doesn't make sense (ie Athena/Demeter).


Some thoughts:
- [ ] The game is too long. I would like to greatly reduce the game's runtime.
- [ ] The only direct way to address this is by tackling the number of rounds and/or number of tosses performed each round. 
- [ ] Therefore, I should try reducing the amount of life the player regenerates each round.
- [ ] I should reduce the number of rounds per game. 
- [ ] Goal - 20-30m per run for a fast player (me).
