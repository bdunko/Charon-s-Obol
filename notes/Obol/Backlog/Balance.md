- [ ] Coinpool should just be ~20 randomized coins per run.
- [ ] Refine monster spawning further. Only a single (or two maybe) neutral monsters capable of spawning each game. The first wave should be hardcoded to be a neutral monster.
- [ ] Make it possible to use patrons multiple times per round; modify the ones where this doesn't make sense (ie Athena/Demeter).
