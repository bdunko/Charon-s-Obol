- [ ] Add a button to disable tooltips. This should also have a hotkey to toggle (possibly tab).
- [ ] Improve prometheus indicator - make the text 'pop' in like the phase text
- [ ] Need some visual effect to denote passive
	- [ ] ideal - rotating pixel around edge, but we would need to do a lot of annoying handling for this; it is not generalizable. We would need to hand-make an animation for each possible coin shape that has a passive. This is doable but inconvenient, especially for trials. In this case, we may as well just make the trial coin size uniform. There isn't really a good reason for them to be differnet like they are now tbh.
- [ ] Patron token passives (Charon included) should do an additional animation or raise or jiggle or something when they trigger. I could see a slight rotation shake being effective for both this and for coin payoffs.
- [ ] can't activate demeter if no coins are showing a life penalty
- [ ] Add a hotkey which, when held, shows the icons of your coins. (shift or control probably)
- [ ] Permanent statuses should say so in their tooltip (OR, the icon should be different - possibly a different outline could work.)
	- [ ] Bury could also say the turns remaining in the tooltip.
- [ ] The status/power used effect (the icons) that appears on coins could probably afford to last slightly longer. Coins can hang slightly higher at the peak of their toss (minor hang time); also probably should not be using a linear trans (if they currently are...).
- [ ] After hand slam during malice, hand should shake a bit.
- [ ] Slight vignette flash red when taking damage. Vignette strength based on current health. Lightly persists even outside of damage taking.
- [ ] Need to clear tooltips when performing transitions, otherwise tooltips can get stuck on screen (try Embark -> hold mouse over difficulty skull)
- [ ] Different coin art for the elite monsters and nemesis monsters.
- [ ] Upgrading should have better tooltips (highlight the changed numbers/aspect somehow). Maybe add a hammer icon to the upgrade price line, and hovering it shows the upgraded text.
- [ ] Better immediate feedback for the payment of life at toss start - ie life moves to Charon, quick text, effect on coins, then flip.
- [ ] Refactor - Colors as global references instead of interspersed all around
- [ ] Art/FX - Power effects.
- [ ] Improve payoff animation; coins raise one at a time and show number, stay raised, increase + or - number below count in pile; after all of type are up, move back down, all numbers vanish, below pile number moves up into number which changes as soul or life is given/taken
- [ ] Death animation
- [ ] Vignette flash when taking damage. Pulsating vignette in black when lower on life.
- [ ] "Zoom out" camera transition to table after the zoom in to patron scene.
- [ ] Play with checkerboard full screen effect with light.
- [ ] Art - Since the NUMBER does not change on Artemis/Demeter/Hades upgrades, perhaps change the ICON to indicate the power is stronger as well? Just minor graphical effect such as fancy pixels around the edges n stuff; maybe multiple arrows for Artemis or whatever.
- [ ] FX - Lighting effects (experiment with)
- [ ] FX - Rising text from payoffs (- souls, + souls, - life, etc)
- [ ] FX - Red flash when taking damage
- [ ] FX - Black vignette heartbeat when lower on health
- [ ] FX - Particles
	- [ ] Death particle effect.
	- [ ] Trail for souls, life, and purchased coins?
	- [ ] Trail for coins moving to hands/toss.
	- [ ] Effect when a coin is tossed or lands
- [ ] Toggle for tooltips. (toggle on/off tooltips as a hotkey and clickable button)
- [ ] Code - Change text color if not original number on numbers in coin tooltip (light blue = modified)
- [ ] Graphics - River scrolls during voyage.
- [ ] Graphics - Pile of life/souls should be in a circular pile instead of square.
- [ ] Graphics - Coin shadows
- [ ] Graphics - Skeletal hand shadows.
- [ ] Graphics - Shard shadows while they're moving.
- [ ] Graphics - Show purple bars (styx) on sides instead of black bars
- [ ] Graphics - Player action buttons fade out quickly when clicked instead of vanishing immediately. (maybe the chosen button quickly moves around a bit or something while the others fade out? idk, something cool)
- [ ] Graphics - Dialogue labels for life/souls should glow purple when changing; and would also be cool if there were actually 2 layered on top of each other - whenever it changes, the previous one fades and a new number fades in to replace it. Sort of like mutating wood.
- [ ] Improve Arrows of Night
	- [ ] Make arrows follow mouse or something (move to center and rotate to follow mouse patron token?); even better if they actually shoot when used
	- [ ] Arrows fade in from light
- [ ] Souls spent to defeat monsters should move to them somehow (turn into particles and move to the coin or whatever)
- [ ] It needs to be more clear when coin powers are usable.
	- [ ] Color filter for between tosses?
	- [ ] Coin label text is gray instead of white between tosses.
- [ ] Animated icons for coin powers - flashing eyes for monsters for ex - only animate when active.
- [ ] When we raise the ante (river changes color), also change the color of the board and highlight on charon's land, life, and souls. helps sell the color effect
- [ ] Zoom out from initial game scene when we spawn in?
- [ ] After you use a power, if you run out of charges, the targeted coin stays highlighted (it should stop being highlighted). So minor. Ex: Athena can do this.
- [ ] Icarus - include a warning indicator above (flashing exclaimiation point) if all coins are on heads. We can also add this for Achilles on tails.
- [ ] Profile on a slow machine - generating a tooltip is potentially expensive, particularly the replace_placeholders (both the coin specific version and the Global call)
	- [ ] Best fix - make this more efficient. 
	- [ ] Easy(?) fix - don't continually regenerate the tooltip in physics_process



- [ ] **Update Shader to work with Spritesheets**
	- [ ] Shader does not work with spritesheets which work across the entire sheet, notably we removed scanline from coins.

	- [ ] **Particles**
		- [ ] Extra
			- [ ] After a flip ends, play dust effect with EruptOutRing
			- [ ] Colored Trail on life fragments, souls, and coins. Enable/disable only when moving to save GPU power.
			- [ ] While a coin's power is active, sparkly glow on it...
			- [ ] Frozen coins have a constant sparkle effect.
			- [ ] Ignited coins have a constant smoke effect.
