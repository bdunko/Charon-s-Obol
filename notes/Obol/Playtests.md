- Base difficulty, lost, Basilisk ruined me. Lacked flip control. Needed more flip powers, but they did not show up in the shop - I did skip a Hermes though, which may have been able to trade me to something more useful (especially with Aphrodite). 3/6/9 tollgate structure was somewhat challenging but not impossible. I could see slightly nerfing the 6 tollgate to a 5. Shop costs felt ok, but fell behind the price curve because of Basilisk flips. 
	- Consider showing Elite enemy on the map as a miniboss on wave 3 specifically, and make it so wave 3 always has a monster appear.
	- Consider making rerolls a bit cheaper? 2 4 8 16 32 etc might still be sufficient.
	- Consider adding more coins to the shop. Will probably need to do this in the future anyway to ensure that you see enough options. Can we fit five in the future? 
		- 1 payoff
