Hi parents! I hope you and your students are having an excellent start to the school year! And although classes are just ramping up, it's never too early to start preparing for end of year exams.

My name is Ben, and that's why I'm here to offer my services as a local tutor for the AP Computer Science A exam. As a Computer Science degree holder, professional software engineer, and former AP student who earned a 5 on the AP CS A exam (Enloe Eagles!), I know exactly what it takes to succeed in this class. 

By working with me, you'll get:
- 1-1 tutoring with an experienced software engineer and Java language expert. Weekly, biweekly, or on-demand sessions with flexible times after the schoolday or on weekends - whatever fits your busy schedule best! In-person (Raleigh/Cary area) or online tutoring, your preference. This is the only subject I tutor, so you're getting a focused instructor who specializes in the AP Computer Science A exam. 
- A printable PDF of my compact study guide covering all AP Computer Science A topics with code examples, perfect for fast review.
- Access to my curated test bank of 300+ multiple-choice questions from previous AP exams and prep books, with detailed solutions (and explanations for how the wrong answers are trying to trick you)! Questions organized by topic so you can review whatever you need additional practice with.
- Full solutions to ALL free response questions from previous AP exams, written by me with explanations.
- 24/7 access to a line of communicate with me for last minute questions and on-demand help. Stuck on a homework problem or wondering why your code isn't working as expected? I'll give you my personal cell number (yes, really) and/or Discord handle to message at any time for assistance.

Computer Science is a fascinating and highly rewarding topic that can lead to a variety of careers in the tech and engineering fields. Interested in becoming a software programmer, robotics engineer, or even video game developer? Learning to code opens the door to all these exciting (and lucrative!) careers. As your Computer Science tutor, I can help you efficiently build a strong foundation in this field and ace the AP exam, while saving you the time and headache it would take to teach yourself this complex subject independently. 

Tutoring offered at $40/session (1 session = 1 hour). Want to make sure I'm a good match for your student? Reach out to schedule a free 10-20 minute online consultation to discuss tutoring for the AP Computer Science A course at your convenience. If you're interested or know someone who might benefit from my services, please contact me via phone (text 919-800-1322), email (bdunko@gmail.com) or on here. I look forward to working with your student!
