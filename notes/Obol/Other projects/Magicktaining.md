You are performance magicians.
This is a scenario based cooperative game focused on hand management with a touch of deck construction, and with limited communication.

The game is played in a variety of scenarios (performances) which have different rules tweaks. This is handled similarly to Sky Team's airport tracks; there is a different physical component for each performance.

Performances are broken up into multiple parts - acts and intermissions. For example: Act 1, Intermission, Act 2, Intermission, Act 3. Players may NOT communicate during Acts (except to resolve card abilities and rules questions), but may freely communicate and plan during each intermission. 

At the start of each act, draw 5 cards. At the end of each act, discard all remaining cards in your hand.

During an act, play alternates between the two players. The player plays a single card, which is called performing a trick. (Note - you may choose to 'improvise', which means to play the top card of your deck without looking at it, instead of playing a card from your hand. This is a gamble!) Each card has a numerical value as well as an ability. The ability immediately activates. When performing a trick, the number of the card you played AND the number of the card played by your partner for the last trick must sum to a specific number (with a small +/- grace range - you get a Finesse bonus token if you match exactly, which may be spent by any player at any time to have both players draw and then discard 1 card). If it does not, you lose a star. If you lose all 3 stars, you lose the game (additionally, the goal is to lose 0 stars, so record how many stars you ended with after the performance and try to improve your score!). Each performance includes a normal and challenge side.

Before each performance, you must BUILD a deck by choosing 3 schools of magic. Each school contains 5 cards. Combine those 15 cards together to make your deck. Schools have different distributions of numbers and focus on different types of abilities. You may wish to tailor your deck to the scenario you are playing (or just find a combination you like). 

Generally speaking, low numbers have support abilities and large numbers have drawbacks.

Examples:
Psychic - Look at partner hand or show cards from your hand
Precognition - Look at top of deck, reorder deck
Time - Swap a card in hand with one in play; move cards from discard to deck
Reanimation - Play from discard. 
Fire - Big numbers that require discard, and a few small cards that draw when discarded
Prism - Multiply pervious card by 2x, 1/2, or {3x or 1/3}.
Grace - Search deck for more Grace cards.
Speed - Card draw, but entirely small numbers
Growth - Card draw for the other person/support
Water - Card cycling (draw + discard)
Wind - Manipulate previously played cards (including the one you just played)
Magnetism - Cards can be used as + or -, choose when played.
Energy - Some 'permanents' which give passive card draw, and some 'instants' which can be played out of turn for effects (like modulating numbers up/down)
Light - Play multiple cards at a time (ie: Play this card. Play another card underneath it, just for the number but not effect)




Performances may change the rules of the game. Some however just follow the standard rules with different target numbers, hand sizes, spacing between intermissions, etc.
Special Performances:
Rehearsal - Short tutorial scenario with easy numbers and a generous range. You may communicate by talking during the first act. You may not communicate during the second act. 

Endurance - The script has no intermission. Exactly once during the game, the players may agree to call an intermission. At this point, resolve that intermission like normal, then continue playing. 
Escape Act - When you draw your hand, turn one of your cards to face your partner instead (without looking at it). You may play that card like normal, but you cannot look at it. You MUST play that card by intermission, or -1 star.
Go with the Flow - Your hand size is 3. After you draw a card, if you have fewer than 3 cards in hand, immediately draw until you have 3.
Momentum - You keep your hand going into intermission. Intermission draws a few cards instead of a bunch.
Freeform - You may play cards into any position in the line (not just left to right). Evaluate the target number when both cards under it have been placed.
Parallel Lines - The performance script features TWO lines of numbers. You alternate between playing numbers on the upper and lower lines. B plays low. G plays high. B plays high. G plays low.
Converge - During each act, you alternate playing cards to the left and right side of the script. Ex: B plays the first card to the left. G plays the second card to the left. B plays the third card to the right. G plays the fourth card to the right. The act ends when these lines converge.
Magician-in-Residence - You may talk at any time during the scenario, but you may not say specific numbers, abilities, or types of cards you are holding. However, the numbers and range you must hit are pretty difficult.
