Introduction
- Game about action optimization
- Five types of interlinking actions
- Static game length
- Replayability (can't always follow identical strategy) through dynamic board growth and scenarios.


The Specialists
- 'worker' placement with some twists - recruit your specialists/workers. workers can only take certain types of actions. must reclaim discs from workers to reuse them, not automatically cleared. workers can be promoted - and promotions have quite a lot of variety, sometimes completely changing the specialist's function

Four Tracks of Action Advantage
- orange - increases potency and flexibility of your actions
- green - gives more actions
- yellow - gives more actions and reclaims actions from workers
- blue - improves variety/quality of available actions
- Focus on small, compounding bonuses.
	- Some amount of choosing what to focus on, some amount of working with what you're given.

Snowball or Sink
- very snowbally game
- more actions -> more track movement -> more actions/stronger actions
- emphasizes opening moves
- openings can be 'chesslike'; there are set specific openers with different strengths/weaknesses
	- each scenario has variations on the openers based on static (starting locations, impact board) factors and dynamic (random locations, random journeys) factors.
- some opener examples

Strategy notes
- Sonar heavy openers are strong. Efficiently raise tracks.
- First goal - yellow and green to at least 2, get to depth 2 as fast as possible.
- Action efficiency - specialists that offer 2 or (at level 5) 3 actions per activation are important and strong.
- Lots of ways to gain a compounding edge; promotion to remove disc -> re use workers. 
- Importance of monitoring tracks; hitting new thresholds is key

Scenario specific notes
- scenarios are distinct
- impact board changes opening theory
- tightly balanced but fair
- replay value through different map generation
- overlap goals when possible. focus on goals, but still need to play efficiently. pure focus on goals doesn't always work.
