No Fluff Analysis & Review of Endeavor: Deep Sea (Coop/Solo Perspective)

Endeavor: Deep Sea is a puzzle-y game of action optimization. The beating heart of the game is transparently depicted on its player boards - the four colored tracks all offer different ways to take more actions. As the number of actions you can take (and the efficiency of those actions) grows, the speed at which you increase those tracks grows as well. An exhilarating side effect of this positive feedback loop is the insane acceleration which defines the feel of the game - initial rounds are extremely fast, with each player taking at most 2 actions from a rather limited selection, while the final round presents a rich smorgasbord of tempting and competing options. It is not rare to feel like 30-40% of the actions taken during the game occur during the final round of the game. From the perspective of the coop or solo game, this creates an incredible tension and satisfaction as you attempt to stretch out that final desperate round long enough to achieve the game's tightly balanced objectives. Those objectives are defined by the scenario (of which there are 10) you choose to play, a unique way to add replay value and variety to the game. 

**The Specialists - Worker Placement Remixed**
Like its predecessor, Endeavor: Deep Sea presents a number of twists on the traditional worker placement formula.

**Four Tracks of Action Advantage**

**Snowball or Sink**

**On Strategy**
Some general pointers:
- Look for opportunities to raise your tracks to their next level. Since the tracks are broken into discrete segments where each segment is dramatically better than the previous, it is important to try to spread your advancements efficiently to hit those breakpoints - for example, during the first round, ending with 0/2/2/0 advancements is immensely better than 1/1/1/1. 
- Focus on the goals. You can spend some actions doing stuff that doesn't directly advance the goals, but not many. 
- Recruitment happens before you gain new action discs and retrieve your existing discs. So if you are 1 step away from advancing to a new breakpoint on the green/yellow track, recruiting a Specialist who immediately gives you one of these colors will get you an extra disc. 
- When performing an action, you can perform that action in the zone of any of your ships. This means that if you have a specialist that performs two or three actions in a single activation, you can choose different zones (as long as you have a ship in both zones); for example Diving in one zone and Sonaring in another. Note that you can also choose the order you execute these actions, when activating a multi-action specialist (ex: a promoted Field Researcher has both a Travel and Journel action; you can Journel in your current zone before Traveling, or Travel first and then Journel in the zone you arrive at.)
- Don't overlook bonuses from the Impact Board. In particular, remember that Pilot gives an immediate Impact on recruitment.
- You don't always have to recruit from the highest tier of specialist available to you. This mostly matters for tier 2 specialists, as they aren't that much better than tier 1s, and sometimes the recruitment bonus of a tier 1 is more valuable. One you have tier 3 or 4 specialists available, however, you should be exclusively recruiting them. If you reach tier 5 specialists, you should probably recruit from them as they are all very good. It can feel bad recruiting 3 or even 4 tier 1 specialists, but it isn't game-ending (I have won games with 6 or 7 goals and 4 tier 1 specialists), it just means orange is a lagging track and hopefully your yellow/green is thriving.
- The point bonus from journals and promoted tier 5 specialists is never going to make up a majority of your points for point goals; those will come from the Impact board. However, it is not rare for them to inch you over the edge, so don't underestimate them. If you have a chance to grab points from a journal or tier 5 promotion without going out of your way, take it. It isn't rare for quite a few Impact points to come from wrapping the tracks from 12 back to 10, so don't neglect this source of points. 
- Journals sometimes offer extra actions, and those actions have a boon:
	- Journal-Dive actions give you two Dive tokens.
	- Journal-Travel actions can travel 1 deeper and 1 farther than usual. This allows you to reach depth 4 or 5 zones earlier than normal.
	- Journal-Conserve actions can target any conservation site where you have at least one vessel at the same depth (you don't have to have a vessel at that zone).
- Don't overlook promotion bonuses! Keep in mind that some specialists change action types when promoted as well.
- Lower depth zones are generally stronger, so try not to spend too much time at high depths. Don't overlook the zone-specific bonuses!
- Don't forget link bonuses! In coop in particular, these are pretty valuable, since both players get the benefit. 
- You can keep 1 Dive token at the end of the round. Don't spend Dive token for Research until you are about to spend that Research (or until the round is about to end and you need to spend down to a single token). You might end up wanting whatever other benefit that Dive token offers instead.
- You can choose not to accept an advancement, if you don't want to advance your tracks. This is only important at the end of the game, if you have either the Orange+Green=X or Yellow+Blue=X bonus goal and don't want to wrap the track back to 10. 

At the start of the game, your biggest priorities are raising the yellow and green tracks to at least level 2, and then level 3, as these tracks give you more actions. Your secondary objective should be to raise the blue track to level 2 so you can move out of the depth-1 zones. Orange is less important early, as tier 2 specialists aren't that much better than tier 1s overall. 

Sonar-heavy strategies rarely go amiss if the scenario permits them. There are a few reasons why Sonar is so powerful:
- Sonar is one of the most efficient ways to raise your tracks, at the cost of being somewhat random.
	- Depth 1 zones give 1 advancement and either an action disc (good) or research (usually not so good).
	- Depth 2 zones trade 2 action discs (one to activate your Specialist, one placed on the board to mark the Sonar) for 2 different advancements. 
	- Depth 3 zones give 2 advancements, often of the same type.
	- Depth 4 zones give ~2.5+ advancements worth of value.
	- Depth 5 zones give ~3+ advancements worth of value. 
	- Since deeper zones give more value, you should
- Many scenario goals require a certain number of discs (or even specifically Sonar discs) in certain zones, so early Sonars are often contributing to the end goals while also building your engine. Travel actions, for example, often trade 1 disc for 1 advancement, which is a similar ratio to early Sonar, but are worse since they do not leave a disc on the board for goals.
- The level 1 Sonar Operator specialist gives a yellow advancement, and yellow is the most important track early.
- Building out the map creates new opportunities and helps you plan your strategy for achieving the non-Sonar goals.
I am happy to take multiple Sonar Operators and perform 5+ Sonar actions before doing anything else (besides Travelling to a spot to do more Sonars). One interesting, but sometimes risky, strategy is to open with double Sonar, which is enabled by most Depth 1 zones giving you an action disc: Sonar Operator-Sonar a Depth 1, then Team Leader-Sonar a Depth 2. If you don't find a yellow from these sonars, take another Sonar Operator for your second specialist so you can retrieve both discs. 

Another possible opening is Diver. Note that with your starting Team Leader and a Diver, it is possible to open Diver-Dive, Team Leader-Journal. This promotes the Diver and gets you to level 2 Orange, plus whatever benefit the Journal gave. Of the 8 possible opening journels:
- 



I have not had much success focusing on Conservation early in a general sense. However, some scenarios do encourage this heavily and it can be worthwhile in those scenarios.

Note that specific scenarios can change these strategies. In particular, some scenarios start you with 3 action discs, and some with 2. The Impact Board also affects the possible openers since the Pilot gives you an Impact Point right away. 

**On Balance**
Early reviews and forum posts have noted that the game's solo and coop objectives can seem impossible to achieve. I generally disagree. In preparation for writing this review, I played all 10 scenarios both solo and in 2-player coop until I had achieved at least 6 of that scenario's goals (the rulebook calls this Expert level). I achieved all 7 (Legendary level) 5 times on different scenarios. So it is definitely doable, and fairly reliably. I have, however, never played a coop or solo game so precisely balanced as this one. The game is very tight. 

Personally, I think part of the problem is the way difficulty levels are presented in the rulebook. Four goals requires overall solid play, and isn't "Beginner" level in my opinion. The skill growth required to move from 0-1 goals to reliably achieving 3-4 goals is larger than the growth required to move from 3-4 goals to reliably achieving 5-7. It is very easy to 'screw' yourself in this game with a poor opening, and due to the snowbally nature of the game, by the later rounds it can feel like the goals were impossible from the start. 

There is definitely some luck in the Bonus Goals and Setbacks. Some of the Bonus Goals are harder than others (I would rate "Fully Complete X Zones" and "One Disc/Sub Per Player in Y Zones" as harder than the other 4, particularly if you get both in conjunction, though "Junior Specialists" can be very painful for Journel-heavy scenarios). The Setbacks are mostly minor inconveniences, but occasionally really sting and occasionally help. Although I believe it is possible to reliably get 5-6 goals every game (at least, this is my experience now after 25+ plays), getting all 7 likely does require some luck, or at least not the worst possible luck. 

I hope the upcoming expansion offers more Bonus Goals and Setbacks, as there is only 6 of each and a bit more variety would be appreciated. 

**Scenario Review**




Introduction
- Game about action optimization
- Five types of interlinking actions
- Static game length
- Replayability (can't always follow identical strategy) through dynamic board growth and scenarios.


The Specialists
- 'worker' placement with some twists - recruit your specialists/workers. workers can only take certain types of actions. must reclaim discs from workers to reuse them, not automatically cleared. workers can be promoted - and promotions have quite a lot of variety, sometimes completely changing the specialist's function

Four Tracks of Action Advantage
- orange - increases potency and flexibility of your actions
- green - gives more actions
- yellow - gives more actions and reclaims actions from workers
- blue - improves variety/quality of available actions
- Focus on small, compounding bonuses.
	- Some amount of choosing what to focus on, some amount of working with what you're given.

Snowball or Sink
- very snowbally game
- more actions -> more track movement -> more actions/stronger actions
- emphasizes opening moves
- openings can be 'chesslike'; there are set specific openers with different strengths/weaknesses
	- each scenario has variations on the openers based on static (starting locations, impact board) factors and dynamic (random locations, random journeys) factors.
- some opener examples

Strategy notes
- Sonar heavy openers are strong. Efficiently raise tracks.
- First goal - yellow and green to at least 2, get to depth 2 as fast as possible.
- Action efficiency - specialists that offer 2 or (at level 5) 3 actions per activation are important and strong.
- Lots of ways to gain a compounding edge; promotion to remove disc -> re use workers. 
- Importance of monitoring tracks; hitting new thresholds is key

Scenario specific notes
- scenarios are distinct
- impact board changes opening theory
- tightly balanced but fair
- replay value through different map generation
- overlap goals when possible. focus on goals, but still need to play efficiently. pure focus on goals doesn't always work.
