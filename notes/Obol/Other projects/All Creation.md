Premise - Players are competing gods creating a new universe. They will create the landmass which the game is played on, birth flora and fauna into the world, evolve their creations, and define the axioms of the world. At the midpoint of the game, they will have the chance to bestow intelligence upon their creations, opening up entirely new ideas for that species. At the end of the game, the god who left the most significant impact on the world is declared the winner. 

The game ends when the pool of victory chips is emptied or the draw deck runs out of cards.

The game is focused on multiuse cards. Each turn, players will simultaneously select a single Action card (from a predefined and constant hand of options) alongside a Creation card. Then the cards are flipped face up and resolved in phase order. Afterwards, players may discard any number of cards from their hand and draw back up to 4 cards.

Creation cards consist of the following parts:
1) A terrain type (the color of the card)
2) A creature type (the middle art of the card) - contains a population number, propagation, required terrain type, and preferred food (if any).
	1) not tons of different creature types - general strokes - mammalian, reptilian, avian, insectoid, piscine, maybe a few more
3) An adaptation (the bottom textbox of the card)
4) An axiom (the top textbox of the card)

Actions:
- Create - Add a hex to the board matching the terrain type of the revealed Creation card.
- Propagate - In species order (dicated by number on the creation card), each species feeds (if necessary) and adds new population to the board equal to their propogation rate. The player performing the action may choose where the population goes. If you attempt to add population to a hex which is already at maximum population, you may place that population on an adjacent (legal) hex instead (allowing the species to spread). 
- Birth - Add this Creation card to the species pool. Immediately place cubes representing this species onto the board, on the terrain type shown, at maximum population. Place one cube on the species card to mark the species's color as matching that cube.
- Evolve - Slide the new adaptation (Creation card) under a species in the species pool. The text on the card now affects that species.
- Define - If you have 3 axioms, remove the oldest. Slide the new axiom (Creation card) under your player board (so that only the top textbox is showing). Score each of your axiom cards, taking VP from the shared pool.

In the case of multiple players choosing the same action, actions are taken in order of creation card number.

Example adaptations:
Some may be negative.

Example axioms:
If there are 5 or more X species on the board,
