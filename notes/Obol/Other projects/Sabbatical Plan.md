   - Conduct final QA/testing  
   - Publish the game publicly

   - Review and adjust budget monthly during sabbatical to stay on track  

4. ‚è≥ **Build Creative Routines**  
   - Block off ‚Äústudio hours‚Äù a few days a week (e.g., 2‚Äì3 hour evening or weekend sprints)  
   - Establish a weekly or bi-weekly game dev journal/review  
   - Participate in 1 game jam or small side project for creative refresh  
   - Create reusable templates for future game projects (boilerplate code, UI kits, checklists)  

5. üß∞ **Prepare Life Infrastructure**  
   - Find an apartment that fits your target rent and location (~$1,200/month budgeted)  
     - Research availability 1‚Äì3 months ahead of move-in  
     - Visit or virtually tour top picks  
   - Transition to private health insurance  
     - Research plans (ACA Marketplace, COBRA, short-term options)

     - Time the switch for continuity in care  
   - Handle medical appointments (physical, dentist, vision) before coverage ends  
   - Complete any necessary car maintenance or DMV paperwork  
   - Set up your workspace: desk, chair, lighting, backup solutions

   - Choose 1‚Äì2 platforms that suit your style and comfort (e.g., YouTube Devlog, Twitter/X, TikTok, Discord)

   - Create a consistent, authentic identity (name, logo/avatar, tone)  
   - Post about your current game development milestones, behind-the-scenes content, or lessons learned  
   - Engage with other indie devs or creators in your niche (comments, shares, devlog replies)  
   - Experiment to find formats that feel natural (voiceover vs. text, timelapse vs. tutorials)
