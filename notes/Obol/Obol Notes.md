**Charon's Obol v0.3 - Myths and Monsters**
- [ ] **Current Goals**
	- [ ] **In Progress** - Weekend
		- [ ] **Graphical Improvements**
			- [ ] FX - Filters for the patron selection and main scenes.
				- [ ] Heavy checker/purple filter on main menu should not include UI elements (tooltips and textboxes). Need to move inside the scenes instead of on main on top of everything.
		- [ ] Tutorial
			- [ ] Speech bubbles should have a down arrow to show waiting.
			- [ ] Darken the screen during tutorial sections where Charon is talking.
		- [ ] Bugs
			- [ ] Trial of Blood - doesn't work. Make sure Arrows do not cost extra life.
			- [ ] Trial of Sapping - doesn't work
			- [ ] Stone - implemented wrong
				- [ ] Should be able to activate while on heads.
				- [ ] Should not recharge naturally.
				- [ ] No flip/payoff.
				- [ ] Update tooltip to match.
			- [ ] Apollo tooltip can get stuck off the top of the screen. This can happen for any tall tooltip. It probably goes off the bottom, then we try to adjust it up, but we run out of space on the top too.
			- [ ] Quickly mousing over coins in shop can make hand miss. Signal ordering issue. Only happens at low framerate and is graphical only.
			- [ ] Can click patron before toss.
			- [ ] Ante cost increase from Gorgons still shows during Charon's Obol toss.
			- [ ] Trial row should be disabled when performing a Charon's Obol toss (ie, clear trial row so modifiers are not active if you die during a trial)
			- [ ] Prevent Hestia and Poseidon from applying if the coin is already statused.
			- [ ] Aphrodite - mention that it can go over max charges.
		- [ ] Balance - overall, the game has been made more difficult.
			- [ ] Arrows cap at 10.
			- [ ] Souls do not persist between rounds.
			- [ ] Coins cost more life on tails.
			- [ ] Coins are more expensive, particularly of higher denominations.
			- [ ] Upgrading coins is more expensive than buying coins from the shop (for the same coin)./
			- [ ] Ante increases triangularly. Ante increases faster in later rounds. 
			- [ ] Monster have been buffed.
				- [ ] Monsters that apply status effects will target coins that are not already affected with that status.
			- [ ] Hades buffed to 10x value for both; additionally, tooltip is more informative.
			- [ ] Trials have been rebalanced.
				- [ ] Trial of Torture - changed to downgrade highest value coin each round. (instead of a random coin)
				- [ ] Trial of Iron - Obol of Thorns changed to -1 soul/-1 life.
				- [ ] Trial of Misfortune - After each toss, additionally makes a random coin Unlucky.
				- [ ] Trial of Polarization - Reworked; now makes the lowest coin Blank at the end of each toss.
				- [ ] The same Trial will not appear twice in a single run.
			- [ ] Coins have been rebalanced
				- [ ] Hermes has an animation to more clearly imply how it works.
				- [ ] Hermes cannot trade for a coin of the exact same type.
			- [ ] Medusa has been slightly rebalanced.
				- [ ] Medusa's tails result now downgrades two coins (up from one).
				- [ ] Ante tails result now increases Ante by 3 (up from two)
				- [ ] Cost of defeating Gorgon is cheaper.
				- [ ] Curses coins instead of increasing Ante.
		- [ ] Performance improvments
			- [ ] Updated Godot engine version - should improve web performance.
			- [ ] Uploaded a desktop version of the game to itch - download and use this if you want better performance. It is MUCH, MUCH more performant.
			- [ ] Some improvements to the UI will be made in the next major version fix performance issues.

- [ ] **Polish**
	- [ ] Upgrading should have better tooltips (highlight the changed numbers/aspect somehow). Maybe add a hammer icon to the upgrade price line, and hovering it shows the upgraded text. 
	- [ ] Better immediate feedback for the payment of life at toss start - ie life moves to Charon, quick text, effect on coins, then flip.
	- [ ] Custom mouse https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/inputs/custom_mouse_cursor.html, if needed
	- [ ] Refactor - Colors as global references instead of interspersed all around
	- [ ] Art/FX - Power effects.
	- [ ] Improve payoff animation; coins raise one at a time and show number, stay raised, increase + or - number below count in pile; after all of type are up, move back down, all numbers vanish, below pile number moves up into number which changes as soul or life is given/taken
	- [ ] Death animation
	- [ ] Vignette flash when taking damage. Pulsating vignette in black when lower on life.
	- [ ] "Zoom out" camera transition to table after the zoom in to patron scene.
	- [ ] Play with checkerboard full screen effect with light.
	- [ ] Bug - clicking and then moving away then releasing still triggers the button 
	- [ ] Art - Change river color after tollgates, and also apply a slight tint to the entire screen accordingly.
	- [ ] Art - Since the NUMBER does not change on Artemis/Demeter/Hades upgrades, perhaps change the ICON to indicate the power is stronger as well? Just minor graphical effect such as fancy pixels around the edges n stuff; maybe multiple arrows for Artemis or whatever.
	- [ ] FX - Lighting effects (experiment with)
	- [ ] FX - Rising text from payoffs (- souls, + souls, - life, etc)
	- [ ] FX - Red flash when taking damage
	- [ ] FX - Black vignette heartbeat when lower on health
	- [ ] FX - Particles
		- [ ] Particle effect on mouse when ability is active.
		- [ ] Death particle effect.
		- [ ] Initial particle effect when new status applied to coins.
		- [ ] Trail for souls, life, and purchased coins?
		- [ ] Trail for coins moving to hands/toss.
		- [ ] Effect when a coin is tossed or lands
		- [ ] Screen particle effect in the wind over board
	- [ ] Toggle for tooltips. (toggle on/off tooltips as a hotkey and clickable button)
	- [ ] Code - Will need to add an indestructible tag to coins and check that in some coin powers. (maybe?)
		- [ ] Better long term solution - powers should specify the possible 'targets' from a list of enums; ie "OwnCoins", "Auto", "EnemyCoins", "AllCoins". Then instead of each case in the match having to check if that power is targetting correctly, we can just check at the start. 
	- [ ] Code - Change text color if not original number on numbers in coin tooltip (light blue = modified)
	- [ ] Code - Tooltips on bottom should appear above coins; tooltips on top should appear below coins. Should be able to pass 'direction priority' to a tooltip. (priority_left/right, priority_up/down - this defines the default way the tooltip goes IF there is enough space for either.)
	- [ ] Graphics - River scrolls during voyage.
		- [ ] River animation in general
	- [ ] Graphics - Pile of life/souls should be in a circular pile instead of square.
	- [ ] Graphics - Coin shadows
	- [ ] Graphics - Skeletal hand shadows. 
	- [ ] Graphics - Shard shadows while they're moving.
	- [ ] Graphics - Show purple bars (styx) on sides instead of black bars
	- [ ] Graphics - Player action buttons fade out quickly when clicked instead of vanishing immediately. (maybe the chosen button quickly moves around a bit or something while the others fade out? idk, something cool)
	- [ ] Graphics - Dialogue labels for life/souls should glow purple when changing; and would also be cool if there were actually 2 layered on top of each other - whenever it changes, the previous one fades and a new number fades in to replace it. Sort of like mutating wood.
	- [ ] Improve Arrows of Night
		- [ ] Make arrows follow mouse or something (move to center and rotate to follow mouse patron token?); even better if they actually shoot when used
		- [ ] Arrows fade in from light
	- [ ] Souls spent to defeat monsters should move to them somehow (turn into particles and move to the coin or whatever)
	- [ ] It needs to be more clear when coin powers are usable.
		- [ ] Color filter for between tosses?
		- [ ] Coin label text is gray instead of white between tosses.
		- [x] Coin flashing should be more pronounced.
		- [ ] Animated icons for coin powers - flashing eyes for monsters - only animate when active.

- [ ] **Maybe**
	- [ ] **(Maybe) Retheme Trials**
		- [ ] Retheme the existing trials to be 'types of suffering' for tier 1 and 'causes of death' for tier 2.
			- [ ] T1
				- [ ] Iron - Impaling
				- [ ] Misfortune
				- [ ] Polarization (maybe remove this one)
				- [ ] Pain - Pain
				- [ ] Blood - Bloodletting
				- [ ] Equivalence - Injustice (maybe remove the bless component)
			- [ ] t2
				- [ ] Famine - Starvation
				- [ ] Torture - Flaying
				- [ ] Limitation - Vivisepulture
				- [ ] Collapse - Asphyxiation 
				- [ ] Sapping - Exsanguination
				- [ ] Overload - Eruption
	- [ ] **Increase Coin Limit**
		- [ ] Goal - 10 coins.
			- [ ] Coins need to cap at diobol size. 
			- [ ] Think of different ways to denote coins besides size - or experiment with sizes between obol and diobol. 
				- [ ] Obol - keep
				- [ ] Diobol - 1 larger on bottom?
				- [ ] Triobol - replace with current diobol
				- [ ] Tetrobol - triobol 1 larger on bottom?
		- [ ] Status row probably caps at ~3. Move it closer to new shrunken coin. 
		- [ ] Move price label down as well to make more space.
		- [ ] Move shop, enemy row, and hands down with extra space.
		- [ ] Look for anywhere we hardcoded the coin limit at 8 and fix that.
		- [ ] Possibly remove a few pixels from the cloth playmat.
		- [ ] Clean up coinrow code some too, it's terrible right now (the coin positioning that is, the math is not very well done - let's redo the calcs)

**Charon's Obol v0.4 - Against the Odds**
**Patron Revamp**
- [ ] Recharge over time instead of at start of round (tosses). 
- [ ] Set max number of charges (does not increase over time), can differ by god. Recharge rate also differs by god.
	- [ ] Maybe max is always 3, but recharge rate varies.
	- [ ] Probably start at 1 charge.
- [ ] Different visual effects to show charge level.
- [ ] Always recharges up to half (rounded up) at start of trial or boss.
- [ ] Patron token should not change glow color when moused over. Patron token should have an effect when moused over (a fun one could be a bit of 'jittering' like it is quivering with power)

			- [ ] Passive - Your coins have an infinite number of charges, but cost 1 life to use. 
			- [ ] Passive - Your payoff coins are permanently Unlucky, but their payoff is doubled.
- [ ] **Difficulty levels**
	- [ ] Possibly - don't allow carrying over souls from round to round. Monsters get really trivialized by this mechanic... 
		- [ ] This could be a thing to put as a difficulty level... though I think maybe it makes more sense to just enforce it as a basic rule. Is better for game feeling...
		- [ ] Difficulty option - Ante increases more quickly (triangular)
- [ ] **Settings menu**
- [ ] **Sound**
- [ ] **Charon's Malice**
	- [ ] Hands hovering over board.
	- [ ] Activates on a cycle every so foten.

	- [ ] Locked - Prevents the coin from flipping, payoff, or being activated for the rest of the round (bound in chains graphically).
	- [ ] Ward - Blocks the next power applied to this coin, then deletes the ward.

**Charon's Obol v0.5+ - Coalescence**
- [ ] **New bosses**
	- [ ] Gorgon Sisters Revamp

		- [ ] Euryale: Stone/Unlucky 2
		- [ ] the other one S: Stone/Drain Souls
	- [ ] Minotaur
		- [ ] TBD
		- [ ] Multiple (4?) "Labyrinth Halls" coins where you must get each to heads 5 times to defeat the minotaur?
			- [ ] Or maybe every time a Labyrinth Hall is heads, make progress (displayed on a special coin), lose progress for tails - must reach X progress to advance.
		- [ ] Minotaur disrupting you during all of this with direct attacks and unlucky+curse mostly.
	- [ ] Echidna & Typhoon

		- [ ] Hydra - Make another Hydra (if space permits) + Damage
		- [ ] Teumessian fox - Cannot be appeased. Blank + Unlucky
		- [ ] Keres - Curse 2 + Unlucky 2
		- [ ] Gigantes - Heavy damage + Ignite
		- [ ] Manticore - Heavy Damage + Downgrade (Venomous Tail)
	- [ ] Ideas
		- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meliae
		- [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_(Greek_mythology)
- [ ] **More Coins**
- [ ] **More Characters**
- [ ] **Coin Gallery**
- [ ] **Tartarus**
	- [ ] Collect 3 fragments of Cronus's Sickle (appears in specific shops; 4 total possible places - you need to buy 3; if you skip the first two they stop appearing since it's impossible). If you do so, after beating the final Trial, move to Tartarus. Charon makes some dialogue here and the map changes/extends to include an extra boss (Hecatonchieres) and the pit (Tartarus).
		- [ ] Flesh of Cronus - Gateway to Tartarus - ??? (1/3)
		- [ ] These fragments don't occupy a spot. 
	- [ ] Hecatoncheires
		- [ ] Start - Lose all souls.
		- [ ] Cottus - Lose 100 life. (-2 for each soul you gain this round). / Destroy a coin. 
		- [ ] Briareus - Lose 100 life. (-2 for each soul you gain this round). / Unlucky 3 coins.
		- [ ] Gyges - Lose 100 life. (-2 for each soul you gain this round). / Curse 3 coins.
	- [ ] Tartarus
		- [ ] Start - Lose all souls. In their place, gain the Sickle of Cronus - which makes life = souls.
			- [ ] Whenever you gain souls, gain life. Whenever you lose souls, lose life. 
		- [ ] Scripted boss battle - oscillates between two 'attacks'.
			- [ ] A 'random' (?) bad thing such as "3x ignite 3x curse" or similar. Or maybe this is fully scripted.
			- [ ] Downgrade 3 coins.
		- [ ] Donate 1000 life to win. You lose if you run out of coins first. Life lost != donated - you have to reach 1000 shards and hit the Donate button. 
		- [ ] No strain. 
	- [ ] Change difficulty skulls so they become black AFTER you've beaten Cronus on that level or difficulty or below. (cosmetic)
	- [ ] Winning for the first time unlocks a new character - The Saturnian (or maybe the Poet (Pindar)) - which has the Cronus effect of "Souls = Life."
	- [ ] Another concept - going to Tartarus has TWO separate rounds - Hecatoncheires boss battle, then Tartarus itself.

			- [ ] Resistance renamed to Poverty
- [ ] Charon dialogue implementation
	- [ ] Change appearance of dialogue box for comments vs dialogue
	- [ ] Malice

		- [ ] Increases whenever you...
			- [ ] Land heads from a toss flip.

	- [ ] Tutorial character - The Lady
		- [ ] Basically play as Persephone (revealed in dialogue at the very end), crossing the Styx in a 3 round game. Charon is more friendly. It's a tutorial. You can't die, whenever you would, during the Charon Obol flip it always lands on heads. There is one trial at the end (and it's always the same). If you can't pay the tollgate, you are allowed to pass anyway but Charon makes fun of you.
			- [ ] During the first round there are no powers and no power phase, it's just skipped.
			- [ ] Explains strain, payoff, etc. Scripted first flip always lands on heads, second always lands on tails, rest is normal. Can end round only after second flip at lesat.

	- [ ] Perseus - Mirror Shield - Stone a coin. If it's already stone, unstone it instead.
- [ ] Unlockable coins + more coins
	- [ ] Payoff Coins
		- [ ] NOTE - Power coins besides the basic one all have an icon and their heads face oscillates (fades) between showing the icon and showing the souls payoff for the coin.
		- [ ] Achilles - High shard reward, huge life loss on tails and destroy itself.
		- [ ] Icarus - Shards based on number of heads; but if all heads, destroyed
		- [ ] Castor & Pollux - Paired coin. Whenever a power is used on one, also use it on the other. Whenever one is upgraded or destroyed, do the same to the other. Same for bless/curse and other statuses. Always lands on the same side as the other.
		- [ ] Hercules - Increased payoff each time it pays out in a row. Reset to 0 on tails. Base amount determined by denomination level.
		- [ ] Niobe - passive - Duplicates (type + denom) of coins you already own will appear in the shop (replaces 1 coin with an exactly duplicat of a coin you own, in each shop and shop reroll). +Shards for each coin of the same God.

		- [ ] Ganymede - +Souls per Olympian coin. Olympian coins appear more often.
		- [ ] Lose life. Gain souls.
		- [ ] ??? - Smoker coin - Gives more than normal, but every heads, ignite.
		- [ ] ??? - Nullifying field - whenever you use a power that would affect this coin, cancel that power and gain shards instead. Very low default payoff. 
		- [ ] ??? - Crack this coin (1 charge). On the fifth crack, destroy and gain lots of souls.
		- [ ] ??? - Every time this lands on tails, upgraded payout.
		- [ ] Phaethon - Whenever this card is on heads, gain souls then immediately reflip it.
		- [ ] Helios - Rises in the east, sets in the west - Sun Chariot - Gain 1 soul, plus another 3 souls for every coin to the right of this, then move once to the left. Also blesses coins as it passes.

- [ ] Add custom seed option in main menu eventually
- [ ] Change RNG so that Trails/Boss/Charon, Shop, and coin RNG are all different.
- [ ] Characters
	- [ ] Define modifiers so we can reference if speicifc modifiers are activate instead of character names.
		- [ ] ie; "doubled damage"; "double_souls" etc
	- [ ] Add a random button to the main menu on the character selector (probably to the right of the right arrow)
	- [ ] Base game
	- [ ] The shop becomes available between every toss but stocks only a single coin at a time.
	- [ ] Single currency - Shop coins and upgrades cost life instead of souls. When you gain souls, gain life instead. Souls and life are a single resource basically. End round whenever. Strain increases three times as fast.
	- [ ] Soul quota each round instead of tollgates.
	- [ ] No rounds - Start with 50 life fragments but they don't replenish. Shop is available between every flip and rerolls every ~3 flips; no strain?
	- [ ] Flip Limited - Limited number of flips (hourglass) but no life; lose souls on tails
	- [ ] God Only - All coins are god coins. You get souls whenever you flip heads on any coin.
	- [ ] Soulpower - Spend souls for powers. No shop phase. Spend souls to gain new random coins, upgrade, reflip, reroll coins, etc.
	- [ ] Draft Build - Draft coins every round after ending round. No shop. Shard minimum to progress.
	- [ ] Gladiator mode - Fight against waves of Charon's monster coins. Damage monster coins with special Weapon coins (function similarly to power coins, use and target). Random coin drops from monster to add to row. No shop (but can destroy own coins at any time probably; maybe you start with a coin that can destroy other coins in exchange for life and doesn't flip? or an item.). Wave based; more/stronger monster coins each round which damage or otherwise hurt you when they are flipped; win by surviving all waves. Life replenishes between rounds.
		- [ ] New coins to deal damage
			- [ ] Doru (lizard killer/sauroter)- Basic damage. Pierces armor.
			- [ ] Kopis (chopper)- Damage all but less
			- [ ] Xyston (long lance) - Damage, 2x to random targets
			- [ ] Acinaces (dagger) - Apply Poison (damage over time, stacks)
			- [ ] Makhaira (sword) - Basic damage.
			- [ ] Xiphos (shortsword)
			- [ ] Toxatai (bow)
			- [ ] Akontia (javelin)
			- [ ] Sfendonai (sling)
			- [ ] Linothorax (linen armor, light) - 
			- [ ] Chitoniskos - Enemy coin effects that would target adjacent coins target this instead.
			- [ ] Greaves
			- [ ] Curiass
			- [ ] Aspis (shield) - Choose another coin. That coin is immune to negative effect this round.
			- [ ] Pelte (light shield) -
		- [ ] Monster can have 'armor', reduces damage dealt by 1.
		- [ ] More simple idea given the monster rework: Monsters are more numerous. You cannot end the round until all monsters are slain. Once all monsters are slain, the round ends automatically. Possibly for thematic purposes, we can still use the 'weapon' coins up there instead of typical payoff coins. You have a set number of souls to spend in shops and earn souls for killing monsters. 
	- [ ] Versus mode/tug of war - No souls; Charon has a life pile and so do you. Soul gains take life from Charon; life gain takes life from you. Take all of Charon's life before you do each round. Remaining life is converted to shards and used to purchase new coins and upgrades.
	- [ ] Cube Draft - Coins last only a single round, then are destroyed. Select a new set of 5 coins from a selection of 8 in the shop every round. Shard quota per round.
	- [ ] Chaos - Whenever a coin is flipped, its power is randomized, except for a single Obol on the left. You can still upgrade coins, they keep their denomination.
	- [ ] Every round, coins are randomized (not every toss). Keep denom and single Obol on the left.
	- [ ] Bag mode (maybe) - Bag building - All coins placed in bag, then a certain number are drawn (depending on how far you are in the game, or maybe upgradable?) and flipped each round. Basically a bit of bag building with the coin game. No coin upgrading. Bag itself appears in the row. At tollgates, coins are randomly drawn until the toll is paid. You start with 8 preset coins in the bag (possibly a few configurations).
		- [ ] Alternatively, only one toll at the end which has a much higher requirement.
	- [ ] Build order mode - Start with 1 Obol and 9 random coins in shop which never charge (one is always a payoff, rest random); shop coins cost an increasing amount of shards to purchase (can also upgrade existing coins as always). No tollgates.
	- [ ] Predestined - Start with 8 random coins (at least one Obol); cannot be destroyed or changed. When spent at a tollgate, gain an Obol of that type again immediately (possibly it should be 'denomination -1' or something until upgraded; or we can use the Locked status idea)
	- [ ] Shop flip - 1 coin is shown in the shop at a time and you may reroll it with increasing price. Plays the flip animation in shop.
	- [ ] You start with "gain a random coin". Shop has no coins for sale except Obols. Can upgrade coins with shards at different prices. Can sell coins back to store for store value (basically merging coins together to upgrade, via shards).
	- [ ] Perfection - You start with 25 Arrows of Night and 1 Life. Life does not replenish naturally. There is no strain. Max 10 tosses per round.
	- [ ] Collector - Limited, curated coin pool selections to encourage different strategies.
		- [ ] Also possibly start with a specific coin configuration and skip first 2 rounds.
		- [ ] Difficulty selector is shared across all coin pools. Tracks highest difficulty beaten per coinpool. Secondary selector for coinpools.
		- [ ] Also abiilty to select 'random' as the coinpool which indeed is just totally random.
		- [ ] Coinpool options viewable in shop.
	- [ ] Imposter - You start with 2 additional Obols of Dolos (or whatever the name becomes for the one that changes powers randomly each flip until used, then locks in). The shop and coin generation only contains Obols of Dolos.
	- [ ] Cannot upgrade coins. Coins can be sold back to the shop for full price.
	- [ ] Exact number of flips must be performed each mode, no life. Tails penalties are to lose some number of souls instead.

	- [ ] The Senator - No life, limited flips, all coins are power coins but their BACK is soul generation.
	- [ ] The Merchant - No upgrading in shop, but can sell coins back. Shop has a bigger selection.
		- [ ] maybe separate or added; The shop cannot be rerolled manually. After each purchase, the shop is rerolled.
	- [ ] The Child - 5 mode blitz, like the prototype; single tollgate, trial on 3 boss on 5.
	- [ ] Power coins are always on heads, but don't recharge at the end of the round. Upgrading a power coin refills charges. Tetrobols can be upgraded to refill them. Power coins are cheaper.
	- [ ] The Emperor - Power coins don't recharge until the end of the round, but have doubled charges.
	- [ ] The Prince - Power coins don't recharge and are destroyed when their charges reach 0. Power coins are much cheaper.
	- [ ] The Wanderlust - Endless mode; shop + tollgate every round.
	- [ ] The Blasphemer - No god coins, only payoffs, gain mana to cast spells, random spell selection each run.
	- [ ] The Heretic - Same thing as Blasphemer but spells available change each time one is used, with a reroll button.
	- [ ] The Fading - At the end of each round, destroy all your coins and regain half their value back. The store restocks immediately when coins are bought. And has a larger stock.
	- [ ] You gain twice as many souls, but cannot upgrade coins.
	- [ ] You gain twice as many souls but take thrice as much damage.
	- [ ] Whenever you buy or obtain a coin, you gain 2 copies instead which are Linked. Upgrade prices are doubled.
	- [ ] Engineer - You must spend souls to unlock everything. Buy additional coin slots, buy additional shop stock spaces, buy trial/map info, buy life between rounds. Coins are free.
	- [ ] Challenger - Every round is a trial round (doubled souls and modifiers)
	- [ ] Cartographer - The map has branches (bit of a lot of work probably)
	- [ ] Wanderer - Daily run mode with differnet mods.
	- [ ] ??? - Designer challenges. Variety of mixes of different stuff. One a week for a year, 52 challenges, can replay older ones. Rotates weekly as well. 
	- [ ] You only have 5 coins slots. Coins may be upgraded beyond Tetrobol.
	- [ ] Twins - You have two rows of coins. Alternate between them each toss (in shop, a swap row button appears which switches between the rows when purchasing. In tollgate, prices are halves but both rows must pay the coins.) You also start with a coin which can swap itself for any coin in the other row (indestructable). basically when you activate the power, it shows the other row, you pick one, then it swaps the two.
	- [ ] Physician - You start with X life (slightly less than normal total sum). You do not replenish life each round.
		- [ ] Alternative/replacement - Titan - You start with tons and tons of life, but you never gain more and strain never resets.
	- [ ] Philosopher - Except for the first toss each round, when flipped, coins always land on their opposite face. All tails penalties are reduced to 1.
	- [ ] Champion - 3 rounds with tollgate between each, all boss rounds, you get 300 souls at the start to build a board in the shop before the first round.
	- [ ] Tollgate after every round, but in smaller costs.
	- [ ] Devoted - You start with 3 permanent Obol copies of a random god coin. All other coins and coin upgrades costs 1.5x as many souls.
	- [ ] ??? - Only payoff coins (but still a few different types probably, and some that cast a 'power' on payoff such as Luckying or Blessing other coins.). Your only power is flipping a coin and its neighbors. You can use that power a limited number of times each toss. In the shop you can permanently upgrade this limit at an increasing soul cost.
		- [ ] Maybe could have sub options of a few different 'single' power types? Such as normal reflip, uh freeze, uh... well there could probably be a few. The weird gravity pull one, some other reflip things. "Switch coin and neighbors to its other side". "Flip a coin to its other side. Then flip 2 other random coins." ???
	- [ ] ??? - No shop, instead start with 3 coins in an extra row with these abilities - Gain 1 random Obol, Upgrade 1 coin, Destroy 1 coin.
		- [ ] Either these flip like normal OR you have a normal Obol and must pay souls to activate these abilities?
	- [ ] ??? - Your coins are randomized each round (not each toss)
	- [ ] ??? - Souls and life are the same. End round whenever. Strain increases exponentially.
	- [ ] Limited coinpool - 10 coins possible, shown on map, some degree of smart randomization.
	- [ ] ??? - The shop cannot be rerolled manually. The shop automatically rerolls afte ra coin is purchased.
	- [ ] ??? - After each toss in a round, increase payoff multiplier (1x 2x 3x 4x... etc)
	- [ ] Bard - No coins are available in the shop. A random set of coins appears each round in a separate row. You can use them for the round. at the end of the round, keep the last one you used. In shop, you can still upgrade like normal.

	- [ ] ??? - Soul quota per round. No tollgates, Limited and set number of souls in each shop (balattro style upgrade).
	- [ ] ??? - Monsters in row with health, damaged by special power coins, earn souls for killing monsters.
	- [ ] Masochist - Whenever you lose life, gain that many souls. No payoff coins. Start with Obol of Demeter. Payoff coin slot in shop is replaced with healing coins. Strain NEVER resets (but increases more slowly, 1, 2, 3, 4)
	- [ ] Sickly - You do not lose life from tails penalties. Strain never resets. 
	- [ ] ??? - Strain is always 1. Coins do not recharge between tosses.
	- [ ] ??? - Skip the first round and start with 3 random Obols. After each tollgate, skip the next round and gain random Obols until your row is full.
	- [ ] Gardener - Your coins automatically upgrade after you've owned them for a certain number of tosses (Obols = 5, Diobols = 15, etc). Only coins in shop are Obols, but rerolls are cheaper. Alternatively, unspent souls become life and you do not regenerate life naturally.
	- [ ] ??? - Coin Prices are much more variable. Shop stock is a bit larger. No upgrading. Coins in shop may have statuses.
	- [ ] Lover - Every power coin has a random other power (of another gender) on the opposite side; "Obol of Zeus and Artemis". You have less life each round.
	- [ ] Charioteer - Game runs in real time. Each round has a time limit. You lose time instead of life on tails. No life limit and no strain.
	- [ ] Merchant - 3 free rerolls in each shop (max 3 per shop). Shop restocks immediately when bought. Coins cost half as much and have twice as many charges. When the last charge is used, the coin is destroyed.

	- [ ] Storyteller - All coins have randomly generated (algorithmically generated) powers. (on heads, with normal life loss on tails). 
	- [ ] Heir - You start with 50 souls and at a shop. Your life is halved in all rounds.

- [ ] Status effect - Sap - Coins only recharge by 1 each toss.
- [ ] Hydra boss - Heads deal 1 damage, increases a bit each time. Destroying a head respawns two and reduces the damage dealt back to 1.
- [ ] Furies - Boss - Curse, unlucky, increasing tails focus; can spend souls to blank for 1 toss.
- [ ] Trial - Only activate 5 powers per toss.
- [ ] Flesh of Kronos - Appears after each trial as an extra coin. If any are skipped, they stop appearing. When purchased, does not occupy coin space.

- [ ] Charon ability - Hunk of Stone - Basically junk you need to destroy.

- [ ] One coin per shop is 25% cheaper "for sale".

**Finale**
- [ ] Settings menu.
	- [ ] Turbo mode - speeds up all animations (payoff mostly)
- [ ] Tooltips to the side for keywords, like slay the spire.
- [ ] Sound
- [ ] Evolving Music
- [ ] Change game resolution; scale everything but the font (larger tooltips basically)
- [ ] Further graphical polish + effects





Characters I'd like to use
- [ ] Prometheus
- [ ] Daedalus
- [ ] Cronus & Rhea
- [ ] Circe
- [ ] Enodia
- [ ] Daemones Ceramici
- [ ] Ariadne
- [ ] Ajax
- [ ] Jason
- [ ] Hector
- [ ] Theseus
- [ ] Perseus
- [ ] Odysseus 
- [ ] Oracle
- [ ] Orpheus

Achilles - high risk high reward
Hercules - 12 labors - starts weak, but heads side gains increased reward each time it is resolved
Icarus - High reward, but if every coin is heads, you lose the game (?)
Helios - Low reward, but high if every coin is heads.

- 12 Olympians - foundational coins that are always around.
- other greek characters unlocked each run, roguelite mechanic
- Flip costs more soul fragments each repeat. Ie the first flip in a round is free, then 1, 2, 3, 4... to make Demeter infinites impossible.
- Shop could have a reroll.
- Charon should start to do antagonistic things after a few rounds; such as cursing coins, giving you monster (bad) coins, reflipping your coins
- Difficult scaling - after you win, the next time you play, the victory condition (toll) will be higher, if you lose, it will be lower.
	- Make this a config
- You can reflip a coin which has landed on heads after using its ability, but it will not recharge even if you flip it to heads again.

**Offering Idea** - this could be a mode someday
- You can spend souls in the shop to make offerings to Gods.
- At the start of every run, 3 random Gods are chosen, probably just from the 13 Olympians and not all possible coins. These are the Gods available in the shop and don't change over time.
- When you make offerings to gods, you recieve Favors. Favors are similar to the Arrows - they are single use consumable items which use that God's power. For example Favors of Hera can be spent to lock a coin, Favors of Ares reflips all coins, etc.
- Basically, you are buying temporary power and luck mitigation, since Favors are always available. It also gives you access to certain powers in a more limited amount since you don't need to dedicate a coin slot to them (for example if you just want a little bit of Hades power, just make some offerings to Hades, assuming he's available)
- It's also just another possibility to consider when spending shards, I guess.
- Favors are 'use it or lose it' and you lose some unspent Favors at the end of each round.

It could go more in depth possibly;

- Since there's only 13 Olympians each one could be more fleshed out. For example I could make up powers for them to act as Favors besides just reusing their coin powers (like souped up versions of the existing powers for example), or multiple different powers possible.
- Gods could keep track of how many times you've made an offering to them and occasionally intervene if they like you. For example stepping in and reflipping some of your coins when you get unlucky, giving you extra life, etc - it could also differ from God to God, what they tend to do.
- Gods could get jealous if you don't make offerings to them enough. Forces a bit of God management? It definitely adds complexity, but maybe unnecessary.
