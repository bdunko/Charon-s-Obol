**Tartarus**
- [ ] Collect 3 fragments of Cronus's Sickle (appears in specific shops; 4 total possible places - you need to buy 3; if you skip the first two they stop appearing since it's impossible). If you do so, after beating the final Trial, move to Tartarus. Charon makes some dialogue here and the map changes/extends to include an extra boss (Hecatonchieres) and the pit (Tartarus).
	- [ ] Flesh of Cronus - Gateway to Tartarus - ??? (1/3)
	- [ ] These fragments don't occupy a spot. 
- [ ] Hecatoncheires
	- [ ] Start - Lose all souls.
	- [ ] Cottus - Lose 100 life. (-2 for each soul you gain this round). / Destroy a coin. 
	- [ ] Briareus - Lose 100 life. (-2 for each soul you gain this round). / Unlucky 3 coins.
	- [ ] Gyges - Lose 100 life. (-2 for each soul you gain this round). / Curse 3 coins.
- [ ] Tartarus
	- [ ] Start - Lose all souls. In their place, gain the Sickle of Cronus - which makes life = souls.
		- [ ] Whenever you gain souls, gain life. Whenever you lose souls, lose life. 
	- [ ] Scripted boss battle - oscillates between two 'attacks'.
		- [ ] A 'random' (?) bad thing such as "3x ignite 3x curse" or similar. Or maybe this is fully scripted.
		- [ ] Downgrade 3 coins.
	- [ ] Sacrifice 1000 life to win. You lose if you run out of coins first. Life lost does help towards the quota. There is a sacrifice button shown (grayed out, like trial advance) showing how much more life is needed. The amount goes down as you lose life through payoff penalties. Also text at the top helps explain.
	- [ ] No strain. 
- [ ] Change difficulty skulls so they become black AFTER you've beaten Cronus on that level or difficulty or below. (cosmetic)
