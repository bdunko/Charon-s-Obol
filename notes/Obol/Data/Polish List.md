- [ ] Upgrading should have better tooltips (highlight the changed numbers/aspect somehow). Maybe add a hammer icon to the upgrade price line, and hovering it shows the upgraded text. 
- [ ] Better immediate feedback for the payment of life at toss start - ie life moves to Charon, quick text, effect on coins, then flip.
- [ ] Custom mouse https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/inputs/custom_mouse_cursor.html, if needed
- [ ] Refactor - Colors as global references instead of interspersed all around
- [ ] Art/FX - Power effects.
- [ ] Improve payoff animation; coins raise one at a time and show number, stay raised, increase + or - number below count in pile; after all of type are up, move back down, all numbers vanish, below pile number moves up into number which changes as soul or life is given/taken
- [ ] Death animation
- [ ] Vignette flash when taking damage. Pulsating vignette in black when lower on life.
- [ ] "Zoom out" camera transition to table after the zoom in to patron scene.
- [ ] Play with checkerboard full screen effect with light.
- [ ] Bug - clicking and then moving away then releasing still triggers the button 
- [ ] Art - Change river color after tollgates, and also apply a slight tint to the entire screen accordingly.
- [ ] Art - Since the NUMBER does not change on Artemis/Demeter/Hades upgrades, perhaps change the ICON to indicate the power is stronger as well? Just minor graphical effect such as fancy pixels around the edges n stuff; maybe multiple arrows for Artemis or whatever.
- [ ] FX - Lighting effects (experiment with)
- [ ] FX - Rising text from payoffs (- souls, + souls, - life, etc)
- [ ] FX - Red flash when taking damage
- [ ] FX - Black vignette heartbeat when lower on health
- [ ] FX - Particles
	- [ ] Particle effect on mouse when ability is active.
	- [ ] Death particle effect.
	- [ ] Initial particle effect when new status applied to coins.
	- [ ] Trail for souls, life, and purchased coins?
	- [ ] Trail for coins moving to hands/toss.
	- [ ] Effect when a coin is tossed or lands
	- [ ] Screen particle effect in the wind over board
- [ ] Toggle for tooltips. (toggle on/off tooltips as a hotkey and clickable button)
- [ ] Code - Will need to add an indestructible tag to coins and check that in some coin powers. (maybe?)
	- [ ] Better long term solution - powers should specify the possible 'targets' from a list of enums; ie "OwnCoins", "Auto", "EnemyCoins", "AllCoins". Then instead of each case in the match having to check if that power is targetting correctly, we can just check at the start. 
- [ ] Code - Change text color if not original number on numbers in coin tooltip (light blue = modified)
- [ ] Code - Tooltips on bottom should appear above coins; tooltips on top should appear below coins. Should be able to pass 'direction priority' to a tooltip. (priority_left/right, priority_up/down - this defines the default way the tooltip goes IF there is enough space for either.)
- [ ] Graphics - River scrolls during voyage.
	- [ ] River animation in general
- [ ] Graphics - Pile of life/souls should be in a circular pile instead of square.
- [ ] Graphics - Coin shadows
- [ ] Graphics - Skeletal hand shadows. 
- [ ] Graphics - Shard shadows while they're moving.
- [ ] Graphics - Show purple bars (styx) on sides instead of black bars
- [ ] Graphics - Player action buttons fade out quickly when clicked instead of vanishing immediately. (maybe the chosen button quickly moves around a bit or something while the others fade out? idk, something cool)
- [ ] Graphics - Dialogue labels for life/souls should glow purple when changing; and would also be cool if there were actually 2 layered on top of each other - whenever it changes, the previous one fades and a new number fades in to replace it. Sort of like mutating wood.
- [ ] Improve Arrows of Night
	- [ ] Make arrows follow mouse or something (move to center and rotate to follow mouse patron token?); even better if they actually shoot when used
	- [ ] Arrows fade in from light
- [ ] Souls spent to defeat monsters should move to them somehow (turn into particles and move to the coin or whatever)
- [ ] It needs to be more clear when coin powers are usable.
	- [ ] Color filter for between tosses?
	- [ ] Coin label text is gray instead of white between tosses.
	- [x] Coin flashing should be more pronounced.
	- [ ] Animated icons for coin powers - flashing eyes for monsters - only animate when active.
