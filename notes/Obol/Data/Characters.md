- [ ] Define modifiers so we can reference if specific modifiers are activate instead of character names.
	- [ ] ie; "doubled damage"; "double_souls" etc
- [ ] Add a random button to the main menu on the character selector (probably to the right of the right arrow)


- [ ] Base game
- [ ] The shop becomes available between every toss but stocks only a single coin at a time.
- [ ] Single currency - Shop coins and upgrades cost life instead of souls. When you gain souls, gain life instead. Souls and life are a single resource basically. End round whenever. Strain increases three times as fast.
- [ ] Soul quota each round instead of tollgates.
- [ ] No rounds - Start with 50 life fragments but they don't replenish. Shop is available between every flip and rerolls every ~3 flips; no strain?
- [ ] Flip Limited - Limited number of flips (hourglass) but no life; lose souls on tails
- [ ] God Only - All coins are god coins. You get souls whenever you flip heads on any coin.
- [ ] Soulpower - Spend souls for powers. No shop phase. Spend souls to gain new random coins, upgrade, reflip, reroll coins, etc.
- [ ] Draft Build - Draft coins every round after ending round. No shop. Shard minimum to progress.
- [ ] Gladiator mode - Fight against waves of Charon's monster coins. Damage monster coins with special Weapon coins (function similarly to power coins, use and target). Random coin drops from monster to add to row. No shop (but can destroy own coins at any time probably; maybe you start with a coin that can destroy other coins in exchange for life and doesn't flip? or an item.). Wave based; more/stronger monster coins each round which damage or otherwise hurt you when they are flipped; win by surviving all waves. Life replenishes between rounds.
	- [ ] New coins to deal damage
		- [ ] Doru (lizard killer/sauroter)- Basic damage. Pierces armor.
		- [ ] Kopis (chopper)- Damage all but less
		- [ ] Xyston (long lance) - Damage, 2x to random targets
		- [ ] Acinaces (dagger) - Apply Poison (damage over time, stacks)
		- [ ] Makhaira (sword) - Basic damage.
		- [ ] Xiphos (shortsword)
		- [ ] Toxatai (bow)
		- [ ] Akontia (javelin)
		- [ ] Sfendonai (sling)
		- [ ] Linothorax (linen armor, light) - 
		- [ ] Chitoniskos - Enemy coin effects that would target adjacent coins target this instead.
		- [ ] Greaves
		- [ ] Curiass
		- [ ] Aspis (shield) - Choose another coin. That coin is immune to negative effect this round.
		- [ ] Pelte (light shield) -
	- [ ] Monster can have 'armor', reduces damage dealt by 1.
	- [ ] More simple idea given the monster rework: Monsters are more numerous. You cannot end the round until all monsters are slain. Once all monsters are slain, the round ends automatically. Possibly for thematic purposes, we can still use the 'weapon' coins up there instead of typical payoff coins. You have a set number of souls to spend in shops and earn souls for killing monsters. 
- [ ] Mythical Hero - Your coins land on heads 99% of the time. Every round is a trial. Monsters are more numerous and must be destroyed to progress.
- [ ] Versus mode/tug of war - No souls; Charon has a life pile and so do you. Soul gains take life from Charon; life gain takes life from you. Take all of Charon's life before you do each round. Remaining life is converted to shards and used to purchase new coins and upgrades.
- [ ] Cube Draft - Coins last only a single round, then are destroyed. Select a new set of 5 coins from a selection of 8 in the shop every round. Shard quota per round.
- [ ] Chaos - Whenever a coin is flipped, its power is randomized, except for a single Obol on the left. You can still upgrade coins, they keep their denomination.
- [ ] Every round, coins are randomized (not every toss). Keep denom and single Obol on the left.
- [ ] Bag mode (maybe) - Bag building - All coins placed in bag, then a certain number are drawn (depending on how far you are in the game, or maybe upgradable?) and flipped each round. Basically a bit of bag building with the coin game. No coin upgrading. Bag itself appears in the row. At tollgates, coins are randomly drawn until the toll is paid. You start with 8 preset coins in the bag (possibly a few configurations).
	- [ ] Alternatively, only one toll at the end which has a much higher requirement.
- [ ] Build order mode - Start with 1 Obol and 9 random coins in shop which never charge (one is always a payoff, rest random); shop coins cost an increasing amount of shards to purchase (can also upgrade existing coins as always). No tollgates.
- [ ] Predestined - Start with 8 random coins (at least one Obol); cannot be destroyed or changed. When spent at a tollgate, gain an Obol of that type again immediately (possibly it should be 'denomination -1' or something until upgraded; or we can use the Locked status idea)
- [ ] Shop flip - 1 coin is shown in the shop at a time and you may reroll it with increasing price. Plays the flip animation in shop.
- [ ] You start with "gain a random coin". Shop has no coins for sale except Obols. Can upgrade coins with shards at different prices. Can sell coins back to store for store value (basically merging coins together to upgrade, via shards).
- [ ] The Idealist - You start with 25 Arrows of Night and no life. Every tails effect is replaced with Death. Monsters which would lose life instead take souls. There is no strain. You must perform exactly 5 flips per round.
- [ ] Collector - Limited, curated coin pool selections to encourage different strategies.
	- [ ] Also possibly start with a specific coin configuration and skip first 2 rounds.
	- [ ] Difficulty selector is shared across all coin pools. Tracks highest difficulty beaten per coinpool. Secondary selector for coinpools.
	- [ ] Also abiilty to select 'random' as the coinpool which indeed is just totally random.
	- [ ] Coinpool options viewable in shop.
- [ ] Imposter - You start with 2 additional Obols of Dolos (or whatever the name becomes for the one that changes powers randomly each flip until used, then locks in). The shop and coin generation only contains Obols of Dolos.
- [ ] Cannot upgrade coins. Coins can be sold back to the shop for full price.
- [ ] Exact number of flips must be performed each mode, no life. Tails penalties are to lose some number of souls instead.
- [ ] You gain thrice as many souls. You take thrice as much damage. The number of rounds is reduced a lot.
- [ ] The Archon - No life, limited flips, all coins are power coins but their BACK is soul generation.
- [ ] The Merchant - No upgrading in shop, but can sell coins back. Shop has a bigger selection. Whenever you buy a coin from the shop, the shop rerolls. There is no reroll button.
- [ ] The Child - 5 mode blitz, like the prototype; single tollgate, trial on 4 boss on 5. No ante increases. 
- [ ] Power coins are always on heads, but don't recharge at the end of the round. Upgrading a power coin refills charges. Tetrobols can be upgraded to refill them. Power coins are cheaper.
- [ ] The Emperor - Power coins don't recharge until the end of the round, but have doubled charges.
- [ ] The Prince - Power coins don't recharge and are destroyed when their charges reach 0. Power coins are much cheaper.
- [ ] The Wanderlust - Endless mode; shop + tollgate every round.
- [ ] The Blasphemer - No god coins, only payoffs, spend souls to cast spells, random spell selection each run. (alternatively, spend some other resource to cast spells...)
- [ ] The Heretic - Same thing as Blasphemer but spells available change each time one is used, with a reroll button.
- [ ] The Fading - At the end of each round, destroy all your coins and regain half their value back. The store restocks immediately when coins are bought. And has a larger stock.

- [ ] You gain twice as many souls but take thrice as much damage.
- [ ] Whenever you buy or obtain a coin, you gain 2 copies instead which are Linked. Upgrade prices are doubled.

- [ ] Challenger - Every round is a trial round (doubled souls and modifiers)
- [ ] Cartographer - The map has branches (bit of a lot of work probably)
- [ ] Wanderer - Daily run mode with differnet mods.
- [ ] ??? - Designer challenges. Variety of mixes of different stuff. One a week for a year, 52 challenges, can replay older ones. Rotates weekly as well. 
- [ ] You only have 5 coins slots. Coins may be upgraded infinitely (Tetrobol +1/2/3...)
- [ ] Twins - You have two rows of coins. Alternate between them each toss (in shop, a swap row button appears which switches between the rows when purchasing. In tollgate, prices are halves but both rows must pay the coins.) You also start with a coin which can swap itself for any coin in the other row (indestructable). basically when you activate the power, it shows the other row, you pick one, then it swaps the two.
- [ ] Physician - You start with X life (slightly less than normal total sum). You do not replenish life each round.
	- [ ] Alternative/replacement - Titan - You start with tons and tons of life, but you never gain more and strain never resets.
- [ ] Philosopher - Except for the first toss each round, when flipped, coins always land on their opposite face. All tails penalties are reduced to 1.
- [ ] Champion - 3 rounds, all boss rounds, you get 300 souls at the start to build a board in the shop before the first round.
- [ ] Tollgate after every round, but in smaller costs.
- [ ] Devoted - You start with 3 permanent Obol copies of a random god coin. All other coins and coin upgrades costs 1.5x as many souls.
- [ ] ??? - Only payoff coins (but still a few different types probably, and some that cast a 'power' on payoff such as Luckying or Blessing other coins.). Your only power is flipping a coin and its neighbors. You can use that power a limited number of times each toss. In the shop you can permanently upgrade this limit at an increasing soul cost.
	- [ ] Maybe could have sub options of a few different 'single' power types? Such as normal reflip, uh freeze, uh... well there could probably be a few. The weird gravity pull one, some other reflip things. "Switch coin and neighbors to its other side". "Flip a coin to its other side. Then flip 2 other random coins." ???
- [ ] ??? - Your coins are randomized each round (not each toss)
- [ ] ??? - Souls and life are the same. End round whenever. Strain increases exponentially.
- [ ] Limited coinpool - 10 coins possible, shown on map, some degree of smart randomization.
- [ ] ??? - The shop cannot be rerolled manually. The shop automatically rerolls afte ra coin is purchased.
- [ ] ??? - After each toss in a round, increase payoff multiplier (1x 2x 3x 4x... etc)
- [ ] Bard - No coins are available in the shop. A random set of coins appears each round in a separate row. You can use them for the round. at the end of the round, keep the last one you used. In shop, you can still upgrade like normal.
	- [ ] Same thing but only with payoff coins and you don't keep them, so random powers each round basically.

- [ ] Sickly - You do not lose life from tails penalties. Strain never resets. 
- [ ] ??? - Strain is always 1. Coins do not recharge between tosses.
- [ ] ??? - Skip the first round and start with 3 random Obols. After each tollgate, skip the next round and gain random Obols until your row is full.
- [ ] Gardener - Your coins automatically upgrade after you've owned them for a certain number of tosses (Obols = 5, Diobols = 15, etc). Only coins in shop are Obols and they are free. Unspent souls become life and you do not regenerate life naturally.
- [ ] ??? - Coin Prices are much more variable. Shop stock is a bit larger. No upgrading. Coins in shop may have statuses.
