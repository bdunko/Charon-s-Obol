**Charon's Obol v0.3 - Myths and Monsters**
- [ ] **Active Goals - Apr 30 Sprint - Cooldown**
	- [ ] **Coin Power Refactor - Saturday/Sunday**
		- [ ] Expand PowerFamily interface so that it contains additional functions:
			- [ ] use_power
			- [ ] can_use_power
			- [ ] get_error_message
		- [ ] Replace the huge match statements in game.gd with calls to these.
		- [ ] Move PowerFamily into a separate autoload singleton and have it create its subclasses there.
		- [ ]  When a power is active, coins that are valid targets should be highlighted. Use can_use_power to determine if a target is valid.
		- [ ] Buried coins should not light up when hovered with a power.
	- [ ] **Tweaks**
		- [ ] **Fix Bugs from Playtesting**
			- [ ] Coin._generate_tooltip
			- [ ] replace_placeholders
			- [ ] are both way too expensive. generate tooltip is the culprit - we don't need to regenerate the tooltip every frame. This will save on calls to replace placeholders.
			- [ ] Additionally we call replace placeholders multiple times in generate_tooltip which is totally unnecessary; just do a single call at the end.
		- [ ] **Balance Tweaks**
			- [ ] Daedalus - require different powers on both sides
				- [ ] or half charges...?
	- [ ] **Info View**
		- [ ] Holding alt will (while held), change appearance of coins to be more informational.
			- [ ] Coin label - replaced with the ICON for that coin.
			- [ ] Coin above - shows an icon for heads or tails.
			- [ ] Shows coin limit somewhere.
	- [ ] **Remaining Trial Work**
		- [ ]  Singularity - Power coins have only a single charge.
			- [ ] spawned coins (ie dionysus) can cheat this; figure out if we want to prevent this and how (ignoring the ignore_trials flag in _calculate_charge_amount might help but idk about side effects)
			- [ ] we should apply this effect at the start of the trial visually
			- [ ] ideally, maximum number of charges should also display as 1. 
			- [ ] better implementation - when we would get the charges for denom, return 1. This should be done through a getter as well. Will require some refactor.
		- [ ] Vainglory - After a coin lands on heads: Curse it.
			- [ ] might not be lighting up properly but idk, check
		- [ ] Polarization - Payoff coins land on tails 90% of the time.
			- [ ] might not be lighting up properly but idk
		- [ ] **Add Remaining Trials**
			- [ ] Tribulations - Randomly apply 3 negative statuses to random coins after each toss.
			- [ ] Adversity - At the start of the round - 3 indestructable monsters spawn.
			- [ ] Fate - Coins cannot be reflipped.
	- [ ] **Charon Improvements**
		- [ ] Charon's malice should activate a bit more often.
		- [ ] Monsters spawned by Charon should scale denom with round_count.
		- [ ]  When you die, when you start a new run, there are still malice particles from Charon for a second.
		- [ ] Charon's malice particles reset after each payoff. Don't do that.
		- [ ] "Souls are mine! None for you!" - not sure if this is working.

**Charon's Obol Release**
- [ ] **Tooltip Evolution - 1 week**
	- [ ] Change native game size so that smaller tooltip are possible. Use multiple CanvasLayers (or scaling) for this. 
	- [ ] Secondary tooltips - a tooltip may also have any number of additional tooltips underneath (for statuses) or to the right (for upgrades).
		- [ ] When hovering a coin with a status, also show a tooltip for that status underneath the coin.
		- [ ] When hovering a coin in the shop that can be upgraded, also show a tooltip for that upgrade to the right. Use a small arrow to indicate. Text differences should be highlighted (differently colored text)
	- [ ] Directional tooltips - can specify preferred orientation for the tooltip (instead of always trying to go down, allow it to prefer to the left, right, or above the mouse).
	- [ ] Add a button to disable tooltips. (tab probably, also visible on screen). - maybe unnecessary now
- [ ] **Sound - 8 weeks**
- [ ] **Revamped Unlock System - 2 weeks**
	- [ ] Achievement system for unlocks. Should appear on main menu.

* [ ] **Graphical Effects - 2 week**
	- [ ] **Improved Graphical effects for coins (ie lightning, fire, wind, etc - basic effects, reuse)**
		- [ ] Play slight particle effect for any power use (burst of colored pixels, color changes per coin).
	- [ ] **Enhanced Monster Effects (Projectile animations)**
		- [ ] Add projectiles for monster coins targetting coins in player's row.
			- [ ] projectilesystem creates projectiles (Sprite2D with particles in charge of moving), signal when it hits
			- [ ] Just need to await for it to finish
				- [ ] if there are multiple, it's slightly trickier. maybe we actually create a projectilesystem, which can manage multiple projectiles and signals when both are done? seems reasonable. it can keep a reference count
