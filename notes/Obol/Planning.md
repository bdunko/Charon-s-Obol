	- [ ] **Tutorial Tuning**
		- [ ] fixed?
			- [ ] During the round, once a player has enough souls, Charon interrupts (just once) to explain that you can click the enemy to destroy it.
			- [ ] Make sure you cannot cancel the power with right click WHILE there is a dialogue open.
			- [ ] Allow the patron token to be hovered WHILE charon is talking about patron passive trigger
			- [ ] Monster text is too long

	- [ ] **New Characters**
		- [ ] The Merchant - can sell coins to shop, no upgrade.
		- [ ] The Archon - All lose life powers are replaced with (simple) gain souls. Monsters with lose life become lose souls. 7 life, 1 life per toss (no ante). Boss is 10 life.
			- [ ] absolutely no gain life powers; also remove athena
		- [ ] The Emperor - Power coins don't recharge until the end of the round, but have twice as many charges.
		- [ ] The Child - uses shorter 5 length voyage; earn twice as many souls; you start with three random additional coins depending on your patron choice.
	- [ ] Coin exclusion list per character to block bad interactions.

**Charon's Obol Release**

		- [ ] When hovering a coin with a status, also show a tooltip for that status underneath the coin.
		- [ ] When hovering a coin in the shop that can be upgraded, also show a tooltip for that upgrade to the right. Use a small arrow to indicate. Text differences should be highlighted (differently colored text)
	- [ ] Directional tooltips - can specify preferred orientation for the tooltip (instead of always trying to go down, allow it to prefer to the left, right, or above the mouse).

	- [ ] **Improved Graphical effects for coins (ie lightning, fire, wind, etc - basic effects, reuse)**
	- [ ] **Enhanced Monster Effects (Projectile animations)**
		- [ ] Add projectiles for monster coins targetting coins in player's row.
			- [ ] projectilesystem creates projectiles (Sprite2D with particles in charge of moving), signal when it hits
			- [ ] Just need to await for it to finish
				- [ ] if there are multiple, it's slightly trickier. maybe we actually create a projectilesystem, which can manage multiple projectiles and signals when both are done? seems reasonable. it can keep a reference count
