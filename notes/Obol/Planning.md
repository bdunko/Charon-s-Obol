	- [ ] **Polish #1**
		- [ ] Filters for the patron selection and main scenes.
			- [ ] Heavy checker/purple filter on main menu should not include UI elements (tooltips and textboxes). Need to move inside the scenes instead of on main on top of everything.
		- [ ] Needs an Abandon Run button somewhere. 
			- [ ] Add an X somewhere on the board on the top right.
			- [ ] When clicked, open a popup window with abandon run. In the future, we will also put settings here probably.
			- [ ] Also triggered on esc
		- [ ] It needs to be more obvious when a coin is active (mouse cursor changes is likely reaosnable - particle effects from the activated coin will also help)
		- [ ] Initial particle additions.
		- [ ] Map should flash when hovered and not open.
		- [ ] Rows need a "retract for toss" option which does not pull back stoned/frozen coins.
		- [ ] Passive coins (trials) should flash whenever they activate - just call a function on global to do this (pass the power type, global scans the row, performs flash).
		- [ ] The different phases of the game need to be more clear - potentially a color filter while waiting to toss, for example...
		- [ ] Fancy mat for Shop.
	- [ ] **Tutorial Improvements**
		- [ ] Make sure map cannot be clicked while Charon is talking (this can happen right after Charon teaches you that you can click the map, which we explicitly should prevent.)
		- [ ] Slightly black out the screen while Charon is talking.


**Fruits**
- [ ] Choose coins to add to update.
- [ ] Choose bosses to add to update.

- [ ] **Coin Graphical Effects - Feb 16th**
- [ ] **Increase Coin Limit Feb 23rd**
		- [ ] Goal - 10 coins.
			- [ ] Coins need to cap at diobol size. 
			- [ ] Think of different ways to denote coins besides size - or experiment with sizes between obol and diobol. 
				- [ ] Obol - keep
				- [ ] Diobol - 1 larger on bottom?
				- [ ] Triobol - replace with current diobol
				- [ ] Tetrobol - triobol 1 larger on bottom?
		- [ ] Status row probably caps at ~3. Move it closer to new shrunken coin. 
		- [ ] Move price label down as well to make more space.
		- [ ] Move shop, enemy row, and hands down with extra space.
		- [ ] Look for anywhere we hardcoded the coin limit at 8 and fix that.
		- [ ] Possibly remove a few pixels from the cloth playmat.
		- [ ] Clean up coinrow code some too, it's terrible right now (the coin positioning that is, the math is not very well done - let's redo the calcs)

			- [ ] Flip a heads coin to tails.

			- [ ] Tap a coin - whenever a power on that coin is used, lose life.

- [ ] Add custom seed option in main menu eventually
- [ ] Change RNG so that Trails/Boss/Charon, Shop, and coin RNG are all different.
