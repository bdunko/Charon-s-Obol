**Charon's Obol Release**
- [ ] **Tooltip Evolution - 1 week**
	- [ ] Performance improvement idea... cache the coin's tooltip and don't update it unless something has changed since the last time it was shown. Ie keep track of "tooltip_dirty" flag.
		- [ ] only need to remake tooltip in certain circumstances...
		- [ ] for safety - on any metadata change
		- [ ] for safety - on any status change (unused atm but good to cover...)
		- [ ] on charges or max charges changed
		- [ ] on heads or tails power changed
		- [ ] on soul payoff changed
		- [ ] on denomination changed
		- [ ] for our own testing, we can keep generating the tooltip string and assert it hasn't changed if not dirty. That can be behind an if DEBUG statement. This will help us catch problems...
	- [ ] **Sub Tooltips**
		- [x] A tooltip may also have any number of additional tooltips underneath (for statuses) or to the right (for upgrades).
		- [x] When hovering a coin with a status, also show a tooltip for that status underneath the coin.
			- [x] Also needs to be added to god statues and patron tokens.
			- [x] and trial descriptions
			- [x] subtooltips should be less obvious
				- [x] gray outline AND reduce size slightly
		- [x] When hovering a coin in the shop that can be upgraded, also show a tooltip for that upgrade to the right. Use a small arrow to indicate. 
			- [ ] Provide an arrow or something between the two boxes
			- [ ] Ideally, keep the price visible somewhere... hmmmmm, maybe we can shove it on the top of the tooltip.
			- [ ] Tutorial - don't show the upgrade tooltip until we reach that part; tis confusing
	- [ ] Make the tooltip from god selection STAY after selection, even if the mouse moves away (transform it into a manual tooltip).
	- [x] precompile some tooltips which contain tooltips
- [ ] **Sound - 8 weeks**
- [ ] **Revamped Unlock System - 2 weeks**
	- [ ] Achievement system for unlocks. Should appear on main menu.
- [ ] **Orphic Tablets - 1 week**
	- [ ] Option unlocked on main menu once unlocked.
	- [ ] New tablets unlocked in progression.
	- [ ] Unlocked upon tutorial completion, populated with initial tutorials rehashing tutorial.
	- [ ] Status - shows a list of all status icons and effects
	- [ ] **Coin Gallery**

- [ ] **More Content - 8 weeks**
	- [ ] **20 Characters**
	- [ ] **100 Coins**
	- [ ] **Charon Extension**
		- [ ] Charon action ideas:
			- [ ] Bury valuable coin.
			- [ ] Ignite monsters.
			- [ ] Lucky monsters.
			- [ ] Bless monsters.
* [ ] **Graphical Effects - 2 week**
	- [ ] **Improved Graphical effects for coins (ie lightning, fire, wind, etc - basic effects, reuse)**
		- [ ] Play slight particle effect for any power use (burst of colored pixels, color changes per coin).
	- [ ] **Enhanced Monster Effects (Projectile animations)**
		- [ ] Add projectiles for monster coins targetting coins in player's row.
			- [ ] projectilesystem creates projectiles (Sprite2D with particles in charge of moving), signal when it hits
			- [ ] Just need to await for it to finish
				- [ ] if there are multiple, it's slightly trickier. maybe we actually create a projectilesystem, which can manage multiple projectiles and signals when both are done? seems reasonable. it can keep a reference count
			- [ ] To make a curved path projectile, x and y simply need to follow different functions over the same time interval; aka use two tweens (one for x and one for y) with different trans. One linear and one expo (or other) will achieve this effect.
	- [ ] **Death effect**
	- [ ] **Rising Souls/Life effect**
	- [ ] **Life loss vignette effect**

	- [ ] Add support for controllers.
- [ ] **Polish - 4 weeks**
- [ ] **Balance - Indeterminant**
	- [ ] Fundamental rule - payoffs which are not showing do not happen. Payoffs which are showing always happen. Ex: Blank payoffs don't happen; Frozen payoffs do happen.
		- [ ] Stone breaks this rule. 
			- [x] Choice 1 - Stone coins are also blank.
				- [ ] Stone is more threatening.
				- [ ] Perseus is kinda bad.
				- [ ] Larger distinction between Freeze and Stone.
			- [x] Choice 2 - Stone coins still payoff.
				- [ ] This makes Medusa less threatening as she can hit your payoff coins on heads.
				- [ ] Perseus becomes a more potent coin.
				- [ ] Freeze and Stone become pretty similar? Freeze is essentially a one-time Stone.
			- [ ] Choice 3 - Just make Payoff sides of Stoned coins blank but not power sides. 
				- [ ] This is functionally just a visual change.
				- [ ] I like this.
