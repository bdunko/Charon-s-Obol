			- [ ] When hovering a coin in the shop that can be upgraded, also show a tooltip for that upgrade to the right. Use a small arrow to indicate. Text differences should be highlighted (differently colored text)
		- [ ] In the shop, upgradable coins (coins in player row) should place their tooltips in the UP direction instead of left/right, to make space for the upgrade sub tooltip.

* [ ] **Graphical Effects - 2 week**
	- [ ] **Improved Graphical effects for coins (ie lightning, fire, wind, etc - basic effects, reuse)**
		- [ ] Play slight particle effect for any power use (burst of colored pixels, color changes per coin).
	- [ ] **Enhanced Monster Effects (Projectile animations)**
		- [ ] Add projectiles for monster coins targetting coins in player's row.
			- [ ] projectilesystem creates projectiles (Sprite2D with particles in charge of moving), signal when it hits
			- [ ] Just need to await for it to finish
				- [ ] if there are multiple, it's slightly trickier. maybe we actually create a projectilesystem, which can manage multiple projectiles and signals when both are done? seems reasonable. it can keep a reference count
			- [ ] To make a curved path projectile, x and y simply need to follow different functions over the same time interval; aka use two tweens (one for x and one for y) with different trans. One linear and one expo (or other) will achieve this effect.

- [ ] **Polish - 4 weeks**
- [ ] **Balance - Indeterminant**
	- [ ] Fundamental rule - payoffs which are not showing do not happen. Payoffs which are showing always happen. Ex: Blank payoffs don't happen; Frozen payoffs do happen.
		- [ ] Stone breaks this rule. 
			- [x] Choice 1 - Stone coins are also blank.
				- [ ] Stone is more threatening.
				- [ ] Perseus is kinda bad.
				- [ ] Larger distinction between Freeze and Stone.
			- [x] Choice 2 - Stone coins still payoff.
				- [ ] This makes Medusa less threatening as she can hit your payoff coins on heads.
				- [ ] Perseus becomes a more potent coin.
				- [ ] Freeze and Stone become pretty similar? Freeze is essentially a one-time Stone.
			- [ ] Choice 3 - Just make Payoff sides of Stoned coins blank but not power sides. 
				- [ ] This is functionally just a visual change.
				- [ ] I like this.
