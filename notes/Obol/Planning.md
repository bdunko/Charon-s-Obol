**Charon's Obol Release**
- [ ] **Tooltip Scaling - 1 week**
	- [ ] Scene 3 - Game
		- [ ] fix arrow and soul and life tooltips
		- [ ] Coin tooltips are improperly offset. 
		- [ ] Patron token does not show tooltip.
		- [ ] Life/soul fragments do not show tooltip.
		- [ ] Arrows do not show tooltip.
		- [ ] Map elements are not showing tooltips.
- [ ] **Tooltip Evolution - 1 week**
	- [ ] **Improved Control**
		- [ ] When creating a tooltip, also pass in a Direction, Offset & Anchor, and if the tooltip should Follow Mouse. 
			- [ ] Direction - Specifies preferred orientation for the tooltip (left right up down). If the tooltip does not fit, attempts to use the opposite orientation. If it still does not fit, attempts to use another orientation. If none of the four fit, give up and use the first and fit it as good as we can. 
			- [ ] Offset & Anchor - Vector2s - Specifies the base position of the object and the offset where the tooltip should be drawn (by offset, we mean that the outermost edge of the tooltip is Offset away from the Anchor.)
			- [ ] Follow Mouse - boolean - Determines if the tooltip should use the mouse as the anchor and ignore the real anchor. In this case the tooltip moves as the mouse moves. 
		- [ ] Coin tooltips should go to the left/right.
		- [ ] Disable _FORCE_MOVE_OFF_OF_MOUSE
		- [ ] Don't show tooltip while a coin is in the middle of an animation (turning or flipping).
	- [ ] **Sub Tooltips**
		- [ ] A tooltip may also have any number of additional tooltips underneath (for statuses) or to the right (for upgrades).
			- [ ] When hovering a coin with a status, also show a tooltip for that status underneath the coin.
			- [ ] When hovering a coin in the shop that can be upgraded, also show a tooltip for that upgrade to the right. Use a small arrow to indicate. Text differences should be highlighted (differently colored text)
		- [ ] In the shop, upgradable coins (coins in player row) should place their tooltips in the UP direction instead of left/right, to make space for the upgrade sub tooltip.
	- [ ] **Disable Tooltip Button**
		- [ ] Add a button to disable tooltips. This should also have a hotkey to toggle (possibly tab).

* [ ] **Graphical Effects - 2 week**
	- [ ] **Improved Graphical effects for coins (ie lightning, fire, wind, etc - basic effects, reuse)**
		- [ ] Play slight particle effect for any power use (burst of colored pixels, color changes per coin).
	- [ ] **Enhanced Monster Effects (Projectile animations)**
		- [ ] Add projectiles for monster coins targetting coins in player's row.
			- [ ] projectilesystem creates projectiles (Sprite2D with particles in charge of moving), signal when it hits
			- [ ] Just need to await for it to finish
				- [ ] if there are multiple, it's slightly trickier. maybe we actually create a projectilesystem, which can manage multiple projectiles and signals when both are done? seems reasonable. it can keep a reference count
			- [ ] To make a curved path projectile, x and y simply need to follow different functions over the same time interval; aka use two tweens (one for x and one for y) with different trans. One linear and one expo (or other) will achieve this effect.
