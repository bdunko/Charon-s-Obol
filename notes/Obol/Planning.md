**Charon's Obol Beta - Coalescence**
- [ ] **Difficulty levels**
	- [ ] Base difficulty.
	- [ ] Charon will unleash his Malice.
	- [ ] Trials have two modifiers and higher quotas.
	- [ ] Shops and tollgates are more expensive.
		- [ ] Increase shop multipliers + upgrade prices.
	- [ ] Monsters and the Nemesis are more powerful.
		- [ ] Monsters have higher tails penalty and waves are more powerful.
		- [ ] Nemesis are stronger.
	- [ ] Additional scaling options (stakes?)
		- [ ] Tails chance
		- [ ] Shop prices
		- [ ] Tollgate prices
		- [ ] Monster costs
		- [ ] Life penalties
		- [ ] Strain
	- [ ] **Charon's Malice**
		- [ ] Hands hovering over board.
		- [ ] Activates on a cycle every so foten.
		- [ ] Graphical effects (glowing hands etc) to
		- [ ] **Malice Effects**
			- [ ] Turn all payoffs to tails
			- [ ] Turn half powers to tails
			- [ ] Reflip all coins
			- [ ] Drain power charges
			- [ ] Curse a coin
			- [ ] Unlucky a coin
			- [ ] Ignite a coin
			- [ ] Freeze coins on tails
			- [ ] Clear positive statuses
			- [ ] Summon a monster
			- [ ] Blank a coin
			- [ ] Increase tails penalty
			- [ ] Give Obol of Thorns. (what happens if row is full? maybe just skips to next attack in rotation)
		- [ ] Sap - Coin does not naturally recharge each toss.
		- [ ] Locked - Prevents the coin from flipping, payoff, or being activated for the rest of the round (bound in chains graphically).
		- [ ] Ward - Blocks the next power applied to this coin, then deletes the ward.
	- [ ] Scales of Themis
		- [ ] Additional difficulty tweakings such as heads/tails chances, shop prices, upgrade prices, etc.
		- [ ] Offers an overall 'weight' which predicts how hard a setting will be.
		- [ ] Unlocked sometime in the unlock progression (late)
	- [ ] **Enhanced Monster Effects (Projectile animations)**
		- [ ] Charon Hands have 2 new states - Open and Slam. Open and glowing while preparing for Malice. Slam + screen shake when he does it (then open while casting).
		- [ ] Add projectiles for monster coins targetting coins in player's row. 
			- [ ] projectilesystem creates projectiles (Sprite2D with particles in charge of moving), signal when it hits
			- [ ] Just need to await for it to finish
				- [ ] if there are multiple, it's slightly trickier. maybe we actually create a projectilesystem, which can manage multiple projectiles and signals when both are done? seems reasonable. it can keep a reference count
- [ ] **Coin Graphical Effects**
- [ ] **More Content**
	- [ ] **New bosses**
	- [ ] **More Monsters**
	- [ ] **More Coins**
	- [ ] **More Characters**
	- [ ] **Steady Unlocks** + **Unlocks for each character & nemesis**
- [ ] **Basic Sound
- [ ] **Additional Refactors**
	- [ ] Separate out Global.gd into multiple files.
		- [ ] VoyageInfo, Util, CoinInfo, PatronInfo, SaveLoad, EventBus
	- [ ] Cleanup game.gd so that functions are ordered better; try to reduce size.
	- [ ] Cleanup coin.gd in the same way.
	- [ ] **Coin Power Refactor**
		- [ ] Each power should specify a TargetType enum. "OwnCoins" "Auto" "EnemyCoins" "AnyCoin" "PayoffGainSouls" "PayoffLoseLife. 
			- [ ] If "Auto", that's how we know not to prompt for a target and to immediately activate
			- [ ] The Payoff powers are used to determine if/how this coin resolves during payoff. Ie each lose life power would use PayoffLoseLife, but with a different charge count.
			- [ ] Each Soul payoff coin could use PayoffGainSouls and automatically update its charges as required.
		- [ ] Powers should have a lambda function they call. We may need to change how certain functions such as destroy_coin, downgrade_coin, and safe_flip function to make this feasible. (these should probably not exist in game.gd. Rather, they should be part of flip, destroy, and downgrade in coin. We may need to add signal emits to let game.gd react - ie coinrow may need to perform cleanup, track active flips, etc. Event bus is probably appropriate.)

**Expanded - Characters, Coins, Difficulties, Unlocks**
- [ ] Charon dialogue implementation
	- [ ] Malice
		- [ ] Basically a counter which increments when Charon is mad, once it peaks, do a negative thing and reset the counter.
		- [ ] Increases whenever you...
			- [ ] Land heads from a toss flip.
			- [ ] Trigger a god power
			- [ ] Payoff a coin on heads
		- [ ] Decreases...
			- [ ] At the end of the round (to 50%?)
			- [ ] After Charon triggers.
		- [ ] Visible graphical effects to imply when Charon is getting angry - flames, particles, darkening screen, etc...
		- [ ] The visual graphical effects imply what negative thing he is going to do.
			- [ ] First indication at 50%.
			- [ ] Becomes more fierce at 70%.
			- [ ] Becomes more fierce at 90%
		- [ ] At the start of each run, Charon rolls a set rotation of 3 abilities which he performs in order.
		- [ ] Ending a toss reduces Malice somewhat and moves to the next ability.
		- [ ] Ending a round reduces Malice to 0 and moves to the next ability.
		- [ ] After an ability activates, Charon's Malice is reduced to 0.
		- [ ] After each Trial, Charon adds a new ability to the rotation in a random position.
		- [ ] Bad things:
			- [ ] Reflip some heads coins.
			- [ ] Curse some coins.
			- [ ] Turn a coin to stone.
			- [ ] Ignite a coin.
			- [ ] Turn a coin to glass.
			- [ ] Blank a coin for the rest of the round.
			- [ ] Flip a heads coin to tails.
			- [ ] Give an Obol of Thorns.
			- [ ] Freeze a coin on tails.
			- [ ] Summon a monster. (maybe do this instead of monster encounter rounds, just have Charon regularly summon monsters over time)
			- [ ] Downgrade a coin.
			- [ ] Deal some damage.
			- [ ] Extinguish Prometheus flame. (maybe half the stacks)
			- [ ] Tap a coin - whenever a power on that coin is used, lose life.
			- [ ] Imprison a coin - locks up a coin (blank + doesn't flip); spend souls to unlock.
			- [ ] (at 20+ flips) forcibly end the round.
			- [ ] Give Obol of Thorns
		- [ ] Separately, and possibly as a different difficulty modifier, Charon may choose to summon monsters from a small pool rolled at the start of each run at the start of any given round. 
- [ ] Add custom seed option in main menu eventually
- [ ] Change RNG so that Trails/Boss/Charon, Shop, and coin RNG are all different.
