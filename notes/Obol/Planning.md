**Charon's Obol Release**
- [ ] **Tooltip Evolution - 1 week**
	- [ ] Change native game size so that smaller tooltip are possible. Use multiple CanvasLayers (or scaling) for this.

	- [ ] Directional tooltips - can specify preferred orientation for the tooltip (instead of always trying to go down, allow it to prefer to the left, right, or above the mouse).
		- [ ] at this point, we can disable _FORCE_MOVE_OFF_OF_MOUSE

* [ ] **Graphical Effects - 2 week**
	- [ ] **Improved Graphical effects for coins (ie lightning, fire, wind, etc - basic effects, reuse)**
		- [ ] Play slight particle effect for any power use (burst of colored pixels, color changes per coin).
	- [ ] **Enhanced Monster Effects (Projectile animations)**
		- [ ] Add projectiles for monster coins targetting coins in player's row.
			- [ ] projectilesystem creates projectiles (Sprite2D with particles in charge of moving), signal when it hits
			- [ ] Just need to await for it to finish
				- [ ] if there are multiple, it's slightly trickier. maybe we actually create a projectilesystem, which can manage multiple projectiles and signals when both are done? seems reasonable. it can keep a reference count
			- [ ] To make a curved path projectile, x and y simply need to follow different functions over the same time interval; aka use two tweens (one for x and one for y) with different trans. One linear and one expo (or other) will achieve this effect.
