## üóÇÔ∏è Sprint Task Lists
### To Do  
- [ ] Add projectiles to Malice activations.

- [ ] Coin small rotate on payoff?
- [ ] **Charon Improvements**
	- [ ] When Charon goes to slam, make him raise his hands slightly first. (I think he already does this)
	- [ ] Improve the feedback for payment of life at toss's start. Have Charon's hand move over to grab the fragments as the retraction happens
- [ ] **Music Study**
	- [ ] Bring into DAW and focused listening/reproduction.
	- [ ] SMTII - Shop
	- [ ] SMTIVA - F8
- [ ] **Game Sounds**
	- [ ] **Essentials**
		- [ ] Power Activated/Deactivated
		- [ ] Coin Toss (refactor)
		- [ ] Coin Land (refactor) 
		- [ ] Coin Turn (refactor)
		- [ ] Buy Coin (refactor)
		- [ ] Hover Map (use standard button sound)
		- [ ] Shoot Arrow
		- [ ] Heal Life
		- [ ] Lose Souls
		- [ ] Earn Souls (refactor)
		- [ ] Lose Life (polish)
		- [ ] Destroy Coin
		- [ ] Downgrade Coin
		- [ ] IgniteTakeDamage
	- [ ] **Death Scene**
		- [ ] Death scene ambiance.
		- [ ] Death scene fade out
	- [ ] **Victory**
		- [ ] Victory fade out
- [ ] **Improved Graphical effects for coins**
	- [ ] Play slight particle effect for any power use (burst of colored pixels, color changes per coin).
	- [ ] Activating a coin - burst of particles; 
	- [ ] Use a power - we already show an icon, experiment with also doing a particle effect. Also perhaps shake.
	- [ ] Shadow - add a static sprite underneath the coin. This might look good enough with how flips work. If not, we can try animating it too. 
	- [ ] When purchasing a coin from the shop, play flip animation as it moves into player row.
	- [ ] Adding 'lightning effect' or similar. We can use a single effect with different colors (or shape/color variations on a single "coming from the sky" style effect). No movement; just appears instantly, shakes, fades quickly. 
	- [x] Flash on upgrade (in shop too).
	- [x] Shake when this coin's power is used.
	- [x] Move up when power is activated. Move down when power is deactivated.
- [ ] **Coin Flip Animation**
	- [x] Coins can hang slightly higher at the peak of their toss (minor hang time); also probably should not be using a linear trans (if they currently are...).
	- [ ] Effect when a coin is tossed or lands(?)
- [ ] **Arrows of Night**
	- [ ] Make arrows follow mouse or something (move to center and rotate to follow mouse patron token?); even better if they actually shoot when used
	- [ ] Arrows are placed on table from Charon like other things.
	- [ ] Add back the slight randomness to arrow pile, it was better. 
### In Progress  
- [ ]  
### Done  
- [x] Blessed tooltip shows (HEADS) - replacement not being performed. Ensure status tooltips being shown on status bar have proper placeholder replacement.

- [ ] Update laptop with Charon's Obol for work travel.
