## üéØ Sprint Goal  
Finish the sound design of the god selection screen. Begin polishing epic, starting with the most high priority items - death effect, improved payoff effects, and life loss vignette. Complete Building Blocks 2.

---
## üß† Dev Notes & Observations  
- Investigate how to continue musical education after completing Building Blocks 2. Check access to Foundations again. Reflect on this a bit.
- Look into Super Audio Cart for sound sources.

## üóÇÔ∏è Sprint Task Lists
### To Do  
- [ ] Add 'divine' sound when hovering a patron statue.
- [ ] Re-export all audio effects and trim silence in Audacity again, ensuring that sounds are not being abruptly cut off. Increase the silence tolerance and threshold, most likely.
- [ ] Create a shorter sound for PatronStatueClicked.
- [ ] Add Death Sequence.
- [ ] Add rising and flashing text labels to payoff animation. The labels should show the amount of souls/life earned/lost.
- [ ] During payoff, add a label including a sum of life lost/souls earned under those piles. This label should update as payoffs occur.
- [ ] Create a custom label class 'TransformingLabel' which has fancier graphical effects for switching between values. I want to aim for an effect like wood burning - flash the new value in purple, as the previous value fades out. The new value fades into the standard black color.
- [ ] Add a life-loss vignette effect. It should be a red tint around the screen edge, in a circular pattern. Whenever you lose life, flash the vignette - more dramatic the lower on life you are.
- [ ] When you are very low on life, the vignette should stay visible (but slight), with a pulsing effect. 
- [ ] Spike - think about ways to improve the feedback for payment of life at toss's start. Maybe having Charon's hand move over to grab the fragments, then slam down to flip the coins, or something like that. Even adding a slight delay might help.

## üìù Quick To-Dos  
_Untracked or small tasks not managed in the structured lists._
- [ ]  Maybe I should start using Forest again. It's a good way to time deep work.
